ADO.NET Entity Framework tutorials
entity-framework ado.net
Does anyone know of any good tutorials on ADO.NET Entity Framework?
There are a few useful links here at Stack OverFlow, and I've found one tutorial at Jason's DotNet Architecture Blog, but can anyone recommend any other good tutorials? 
Any tutorials available from Microsoft, either online or as part of any conference/course material?


Sample application from MSDN
And some inside information from ADO.NET Team Blog

Here are some that Julie Lerman wrote:
