How do I reuse a command in bash with different parameters?
bash command-line scripting
I have two scripts that often need to be run with the same parameter:
$ populate.ksh 9241 && check.ksh 9241

When I need to change the parameter (9241 in this example), I can go back and edit the line in history.  But since I need to change the number in two places, I sometimes make a typo.  I'd like to be able to change the parameter just once to change it in both places.


One solution is to simply create a wrapper script (populate_check.ksh) that calls the scripts in turn:
r=$1
populate.ksh $r && check.ksh $r

Or for multiple parameters:
for r; do
   populate.ksh $r && check.ksh $r
done

For tasks that are more transient, you can also parametrize the command so that it's easier to edit in history:
$ r=9241; populate.ksh $r && check.ksh $r

Or to do several at once:
$ for r in 9241 9242; do populate.ksh $r && check.ksh $r; done


You can also use the history substitution feature:
!pop:gs/9241/1234

Like so:
$ populate.ksh 9241 && check.ksh 9241
...
$ !pop:gs/9241/1234
populate.ksh 1234 && check.ksh 1234
...


In bash:
!!:gs/9241/9243/

Yes, it uses gs///, not s///g. :-)
(zigdon's answer uses the last command starting with pop, such as populate.sh. My answer uses the last command, full stop. Choose which works for you.)

Correct answers have already been given, but for a more general understanding read the manpage with special attention to "History Expansion" and the associated shell variables (such as "HISTCONTROL", "histchars", etc.). BTW-- Your pager's search function is very useful when reading man bash
