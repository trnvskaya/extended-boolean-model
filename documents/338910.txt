Simple protocol for remote process startup/shutdown
protocols process-management remote-process
I'm looking for a simple protocol to control remote processes from one managing application. The remote processes will run on Windows and Linux (x86).
Is there a simple protocol for managing remote processes, for which I could find daemons that run on both Windows and Linux?


I consider ssh to be the "Swiss-army knife" of remote administration. A custom script communicating over ssh can then do the process management. On Windows, I install ssh as part of Cygwin.

On windows you can use shutdown.exe \\remote_name [/y] [/c]

Thanks Nathan.
Windows users can also use the following package instead of Cygwin: http://sshwindows.sourceforge.net/
