In an MFC application, what's the easiest way to copy a file from one directory to another?
c++ windows mfc file
Should I create two CFile objects and copy one into the other character by character?  Or is there something in the library that will do this for me?


I would just use the CopyFile Win32 API function, but the example code in the CFile::Open documentation shows how to copy files with CFile (using pretty much the method you suggest).

It depends on what you want to do. There are a number of ways to copy files:

CopyFile()
CopyFileEx()
SHFileOperation()
IFileOperation (replaces SHFileOperation() in Vista)
