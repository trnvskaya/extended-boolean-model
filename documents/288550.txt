Sidebar form
delphi
How can I create a Sidebar form in delphi.
I try the ScreenSnap and Align properties
but I need that the form stay visible even if the user maximize other forms, without been on top. Just like the windows sidebar do.
update from the comments: if a window is maximized it maximizes next too the window, not in front of or behind.
Thanks 


You can call a Windows API function to force your application to stay on top:
SetWindowPos(Handle, HWND_TOPMOST, 0, 0, 0, 0, SWP_NOMOVE | SWP_NOSIZE);


What you're looking for is called an AppBar. Begin your research with the ShAppBarMessage API function.
