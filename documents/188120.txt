Can I specify my explicit type comparator inline?
c# .net linq lambda
So .NET 3.0/3.5 provides us with lots of new ways to query, sort, and manipulate data, thanks to all the neat functions supplied with LINQ.  Sometimes, I need to compare user-defined types that don't have a built-in comparison operator.  In many cases, the comparison is really simple -- something like foo1.key ?= foo2.key.  Rather than creating a new IEqualityComparer for the type, can I simply specify the comparison inline using anonymous delegates/lambda functions?  Something like:
var f1 = ...,
    f2 = ...;
var f3 = f1.Except(
           f2, new IEqualityComparer(
             (Foo a, Foo b) => a.key.CompareTo(b.key)
           ) );

I'm pretty sure the above doesn't actually work.  I just don't want to have to make something as "heavy" as a whole class just to tell the program how to compare apples to apples.


My MiscUtil library contains a ProjectionComparer to build an IComparer<T> from a projection delegate. It would be the work of 10 minutes to make a ProjectionEqualityComparer to do the same thing.
EDIT: Here's the code for ProjectionEqualityComparer:

using System.Collections.Generic;

    {
        return new ProjectionEqualityComparer<TSource, TKey>(projection);
    }

        (TSource ignored,
         Func<TSource, TKey> projection)
    {
        return new ProjectionEqualityComparer<TSource, TKey>(projection);
    }

}

    public ProjectionEqualityComparer(Func<TSource, TKey> projection, IEqualityComparer<TKey> comparer)
    {
        if (projection == null)
        {
            throw new ArgumentNullException("projection");
        }
        this.comparer = comparer ?? EqualityComparer<TKey>.Default;
        this.projection = projection;
    }

    /// <summary>

    public bool Equals(TSource x, TSource y)
    {
        if (x == null && y == null)
        {
            return true;
        }
        if (x == null || y == null)
        {
            return false;
        }
        return comparer.Equals(projection(x), projection(y));
    }

    /// <summary>
    /// Produces a hash code for the given value by projecting it and

    /// </summary>
    public int GetHashCode(TSource obj)
    {
        if (obj == null)
        {
            throw new ArgumentNullException("obj");
        }
        return comparer.GetHashCode(projection(obj));
    }
}

And here's a sample use:
var f3 = f1.Except(f2, ProjectionEqualityComparer<Foo>.Create(a => a.key));


I find providing extra helpers on IEnumerable is a cleaner way to do this.
See: this question
So you could have: 
var f3 = f1.Except(
           f2, 
             (a, b) => a.key.CompareTo(b.key)
            );

If you define the extension methods properly

here is a simple helper class that should do what you want
public class EqualityComparer<T> : IEqualityComparer<T>
{
    public EqualityComparer(Func<T, T, bool> cmp)
    {
        this.cmp = cmp;
    }
    public bool Equals(T x, T y)
    {
        return cmp(x, y);
    }

    public int GetHashCode(T obj)
    {
        return obj.GetHashCode();
    }

    public Func<T, T, bool> cmp { get; set; }
}

you can use it like this:
processed.Union(suburbs, new EqualityComparer<Suburb>((s1, s2)
    => s1.SuburbId == s2.SuburbId));


This project does something similar: AnonymousComparer - lambda compare selector for Linq, it has Extensions for LINQ Standard Query Operators as well.

Why not something like: 
    public class Comparer<T> : IEqualityComparer<T>
    {
        private readonly Func<T, T, bool> _equalityComparer;

        public Comparer(Func<T, T, bool> equalityComparer)
        {
            _equalityComparer = equalityComparer;
        }

        public bool Equals(T first, T second)
        {
            return _equalityComparer(first, second);
        }

        public int GetHashCode(T value)
        {
            return value.GetHashCode();
        }
    }

and then you could do for instance something like (e.g. in the case of Intersect in IEnumerable<T>):
list.Intersect(otherList, new Comparer<T>( (x, y) => x.Property == y.Property));

The Comparer class can be put in a utilities project and used wherever is needed.
I only now see the Sam Saffron's answer (which is very similar to this one).

For small sets, you can do:
f3 = f1.Where(x1 => f2.All(x2 => x2.key != x1.key));

For large sets, you will want something more efficient in the search like:
var tmp = new HashSet<string>(f2.Select(f => f.key));
f3 = f1.Where(f => tmp.Add(f.key));

But, here, the Type of key must implement IEqualityComparer (above I assumed it was a string). So, this doesn't really answer your question about using a lambda in this situation but it does use less code then some of the answers that do.
You might rely on the optimizer and shorten the second solution to:
f3 = f1.Where(x1 => (new HashSet<string>(f2.Select(x2 => x2.key))).Add(x1.key));

but, I haven't run tests to know if it runs at the same speed. And that one liner might be too clever to maintain.
