What is the best online book service for software development references?
reference
I'm a member of ACM, and I have limited access to both Books 24x7 and Safari Books Online, however if I was interested in moving up to a full account for greater access to other books what online book service would you recommend?


I have Books 24x7, it has a great range of books and the search functionality works well. It also gives you recommendations from other users, and if other people from your organization join then it tells you about books they have recommended.

Audible - Self Development, Business and Education sections!

Safari Books Online has a corporate subscription service which companies appreciate.

Safari Books Online..  By far..

I think it depends on how much you want O'Reilly and Pearson Technology books (which includes many smaller publishers like Peachpit).  Safari has exclusive rights to those titles. Safari also has a monthly subscription level so you don't have to commit to an entire year.

Safari Books Online is my choice, here's a related post:
