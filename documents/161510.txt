'pass parameter by reference' in Ruby?
ruby parameter-passing pass-by-reference
In Ruby, is it possible to pass by reference a parameter with value-type semantics (e.g. a Fixnum)?
I'm looking for something similar to C#'s 'ref' keyword.
Example:
def func(x) 
    x += 1
end

a = 5
func(a)  #this should be something like func(ref a)
puts a   #should read '6'

Btw. I know I could just use:
a = func(a)



Ruby doesn't support "pass by reference" at all. Everything is an object and the references to those objects are always passed by value. Actually, in your example you are passing a copy of the reference to the Fixnum Object by value.
The problem with the your code is, that x += 1 doesn't modify the passed Fixnum Object but instead creates a completely new and independent object.
I think, Java programmers would call Fixnum objects immutable. 

You can accomplish this by explicitly passing in the current binding:
def func(x, bdg)
  eval "#{x} += 1", bdg
end

a = 5
func(:a, binding)
puts a # => 6


In Ruby you can't pass parameters by reference. For your example, you would have to return the new value and assign it to the variable a or create a new class that contains the value and pass an instance of this class around. Example:
class Container
attr_accessor :value
 def initialize value
   @value = value
 end
end

def func(x)
  x.value += 1
end

a = Container.new(5)
func(a)
puts a.value


You can try following trick:
def func(x) 
    x[0] += 1
end

a = [5]
func(a)  #this should be something like func(ref a)
puts a[0]   #should read '6'

Fixnum objects have immediate value. This means that when they are assigned or
  passed as parameters, the actual object is passed, rather than a reference to
  that object.

Also Ruby is pass by value.
