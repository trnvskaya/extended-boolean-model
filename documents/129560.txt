Sql server real datatype, what is the C# equivalent?
c# sql-server
What is the C# equivalent to the sql server 2005 real type?


it is a Single
see here for more info on SQL Server to .Net DataTypes

Single is not the correct answer as it rounds the  decimal part.. For instance 2.0799999
 will be  converted to 2.08. If there are no constraints regarding the rounding then it should be good.

Double can be used as the .NET Equivalent Datatype for Real Datatype of SQL Server
Double gets the exact value with out Rounding

in my project (acces -> firebird and ms sql -> c#) is real defined like single precission float point number...so I used float and everything is OK

The answer is float. If you try to use double as the type in the code but your field type in the database is real it will errors out. I just tested this myself and confirmed it errors with double.
