How do I set the default database in Sql Server from code?
sql-server database
I can't seem to figure out how to set the default database in Sql Server from code. This can be either .Net code or T-Sql (T-Sql would be nice since it would be easy to use in any language). I searched Google and could only find how to do it in Sql Server Management Studio.


from: http://doc.ddart.net/mssql/sql70/sp_da-di_6.htm
sp_defaultdb [@loginame =] 'login' , [@defdb =] 'database'


If you're trying to change which database you are using after you are logged in, you can use the USE command.  E.g. USE Northwind.

ALTER LOGIN should be used for SQL Server 2005 or later:
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms189828.aspx
ALTER LOGIN <login_name> WITH DEFAULT_DATABASE = <default_database>

sp_defaultdb eventually will be removed from SQL Server:

Thanks Stephen. 
As a note, if you are using Windows Authentication, the @loginname is YourDomain\YourLogin (probably obvious to everybody else, but took me a couple tries.
sp_defaultdb @loginame='YourDomain\YourLogin', @defdb='YourDatabase'
