Considering the full list of PDC videos published here what are, in your opinion, the best session to download and see, considering their relevance to your work, technology and so on? Pleas, one session per answer (exception only for the sessions split in two parts) and please vote it so to move the best ones to the top.


For me the best session was the Mono one, really worth looking at.

I would have to say that my favorite session was the "future of C#" video, very nice to be able to see what is coming in the future for C# and the .NET framework.

I realy enjoyed watching A Lap Around VSTS 2010. But the C# IDE tips and tricks session is my favourite of those I've watched so far. I shows a lot of simple short-cuts and tools that make your every day life a bit easier. 

I think my favourite was the Parallel Programming one

I can recommend the ones about "Velocity". I found them really interesting when I was there, but if you're not interested in that, you should also check out the ones targeted at parallelism.

If you are doing thread parallel work: 
TL58 Research: Concurrency Analysis Platform and Tools for Finding Concurrency Bugs 
and
TL55 The Concurrency and Coordination Runtime and Decentralized Software Services Toolkit
Finally progress towards deterministic testing and debugging of concurrent programs.
