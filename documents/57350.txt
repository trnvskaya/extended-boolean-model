How do I get the current user's Local Settings folder path in C#?
c# .net windows
I want to point a file dialog at a particular folder in the current user's Local Settings folder on Windows.  What is the shortcut to get this path?


Environment.GetFolderPath( Environment.SpecialFolders.LocalApplicationData);?
I can't remember if there is a "Local Settings" folder on Windows XP anymore, it seems vaguely familiar.

How about this, for example:
String appData = 
    Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.LocalApplicationData);

I don't see an enum for just the Local Settings folder.

string localPath = Directory.GetParent(Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.LocalApplicationData)).FullName;

is the simple answer.
