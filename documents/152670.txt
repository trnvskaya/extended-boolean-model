How to stop the Access 2007 Configuration Progress when switching versions
ms-access ms-access-2007
Like many developers I need to run more than 1 version of MS Access.  I have just installed Access 2007.  If I open Access 2003 and then open Access 2007 I have to wait 3mins for the 'Configuring Microsoft Office Enterprise 2007..." dialog.  Then if I open Access 2003 again it takes another 30secs or so to configure that.  
PLEASE NOTE: I am using shortcuts to open the files that include the full path to Access.  Eg to open Access 2007:
 "C:\program files\microsoft office 12\office12\msaccess.exe" "C:\test.accdb"

and for 2003:
 "C:\program files\microsoft office 11\office11\msaccess.exe" "C:\test.mdb"

Does anyone have a solution to avoid this?  


This is caused by Windows Installer, which is used by both installers. Advertised shortcuts as used by both Office 2003 and Office 2007 invoke Windows Installer to check that the entire feature is installed properly; the installer detects that something else (in this case the other product) has registered the file extensions used by Access (possibly the ProgIds as well) and decides that a repair is necessary, so it invokes the 'Configuring Office' dialog and proceeds to reinstall various components.
To avoid this, run Access from Program Files directly; create shortcuts if you'll be doing this frequently.

Want to cut it down to about 20 seconds to reconfigure Access 2007 after opening Access 2003?  Download and install Office 2007 sp1:

Btw, you can't avoid the reconfiguration between Access 2007 and earlier versions.  Access 2007 uses some of the same registry keys as earlier versions and they have to be rewritten when opening Access 2007.

The best workaround I've found for this is to use VMWare Thinapp to virtualize one (or more) of the offending versions of Access:

It's a little more lightweight than a full Virtual PC / VMWare / etc installation, but unfortunately still a bit of a hassle to set up and not free.

The fix to the problem is very simple as it turns out - 
simply run the following commands (by pressing the Windows Key+R or typing it into the Start/Run command box. 
 Use the line with Office\11.0 if you have Office 2003 installed and Office\12.0 if you have Office 2007 installed. 
 You can use both if you have both installed :
reg add HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\Word\Options /v NoReReg /t REG_DWORD /d 1

reg add HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Word\Options /v NoReReg /t REG_DWORD /d 1

That is it.  Office 2007 might want to have one more spin round the block with it's configuration dialog box, but that should be it. 
C: \Program Files>Common Files>microsoft shared>OFFICE12>Office Setup Controller>SETUP.exe change to SETUPold.exe
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\Access.Application]
This key will cause the config screen to constantly cycle everytime you open Access 2007.
By deleting the key and everything under it, it fixes the cycling problem and Access 2007 opens right away.

Just Install Office 2007 Sp2, that works.
