Swing: Canvas overlaps menu
java swing
I have a JFrame with a menu bar and a canvas covering all the remaining surface. When I click on the menu bar, the menu opens behind the Canvas and I can't see it. Has anyone experienced this? Other than resizing the Canvas (which I am reluctant to do) is there any solution?
Thanks,
Vlad


You're experiencing heavyweight vs. lightweight issues.
The quick fix: 
// Call this sometime before you use your menus 
JPopupMenu.setDefaultLightWeightPopupEnabled(false)

Heavyweight vs. Lightweight

That happened to me when i resized a Canvas that is on a JFrame.
I just had to call 

validate()
  on the JFrame after the resize.

Good luck!
