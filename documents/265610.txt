Best tool for creating a societal model
language-features modeling
Lets say I wanted to create some software that models a society. People exist, meet, have children, learn, share experiences etc. Which programming language should I use?
I would assume that a dynamic language that enables me to swap out methods and/or implement types at run-time would reduce the amount of plumbing that i'd otherwise have to create in a statically typed language. Am I correct?


try designing the interaction model first, then choosing a language. Paper prototypes for feasibility might be instructive as well. If you haven't done the design, it is wildly premature to select the implemenation platform and language.

Sounds like ruby. Dynamic, Swap out methods. Here are some of the feature ( from Wikipedia ) 

Object-oriented, "everything is an
object"
Five levels of variable scope:
global, class, instance, local, and
block
Exception handling
Iterators and closures (based on
passing blocks of code)
Native, Perl-like regular
expressions at the language level
Operator overloading
Automatic garbage collecting
Highly portable Cooperative
multi-threading on all platforms
using green threads
DLL/Shared library dynamic loading
on most platforms
Introspection, reflection and
metaprogramming
Large standard library
Supports dependency injection
Supports object runtime alteration
Continuations and generators


In my earlier question I mentioned Repast, Swarm,  and MASS as agent-based modeling frameworks. They are useful tools to model societies of agents.
