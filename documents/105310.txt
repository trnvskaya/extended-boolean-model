Where'd my generic ActionLink go?
asp.net asp.net-mvc
Moved from preview 2 to preview 5 and now my Html.ActionLink calls are all failing.  It appears that the generic version has been replaced with a non-type safe version.
// used to work
<li>
  <%= Html.ActionLink<HomeController>(c => c.Index(), "Home")%>
</li>
// what appears I can only do now
<li>
  <%= Html.ActionLink<HomeController>("Index", "Home")%>
</li>

Why did The Gu do this?  Has it been moved to Microsoft.Web.Mvc or somewhere else as a "future"?  Is there a replacement that is generic?  Halp! 


Don't blame the GU, it's my fault. That method has been moved to MvcFutures. Here's a blog post that provides the foundation for why this change was made.
