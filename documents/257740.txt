How do you access an attached property of a Silverlight object in C#?
c# silverlight
Basically I'm trying to change the Canvas.Left property of an Ellipse Silverlight control in C#.  Here is how I'm accessing the control:
Ellipse c1 = this.FindName("Circle1") as Ellipse;

How would I then set the Canvas.Left property?
Thanks,
Jeff


The answer lies in Silverlights use of Dependancy Properties
c1.SetValue(Canvas.LeftProperty, value);

something like this...
double left=50;
c1.SetValue(Canvas.LeftProperty, left);


Another way
Canvas.SetLeft(c1,value)
