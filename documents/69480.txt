How do I change the background color in gnuplot?
gnuplot
I have a script that renders graphs in gnuplot. The graphs all end up with an ugly white background. How do I change this? (Ideally, with a command that goes into a gnuplot script, as opposed to a command-line option or something in a settings file)


It is a setting for some terminal (windows use background).  Check out colorbox including its bdefault.

Ooh, found it. It's along the lines of:
set terminal png x222222 xffffff


You can change the background color by command set object 1 rectangle from screen 0,0 to screen 1,1 fillcolor rgb"green" behind to set the background color to the  the color you specified (here is green).
