How to know whether a window with a given title is already open in Tk?
python tkinter tk
Iâve writen a little python script that just pops up a message box containing the text passed on the command line. I want to pop it up only when the window âresulting from a previous callâ is not open.
from Tkinter import *
import tkMessageBox

root = Tk()
root.withdraw() 

# TODO not if a window with this title exists
tkMessageBox.showinfo("Key you!", " ".join(sys.argv[1:]))

Any idea how to check that?


I believe you want:
if 'normal' != root.state():
    tkMessageBox.showinfo("Key you!", " ".join(sys.argv[1:]))
