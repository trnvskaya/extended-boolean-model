C++ to Perl/Tk
c++ perl perltk
I have to do a college project using C++. It also requires a GUI and I want to use Perl/Tk for the Gui, but am not sure how to link the C++ to the Perl. The project requires being able to pass variables back and forth. Could anyone point me in the direction of some good tutorials/books for linking the two? Or any ideas on how I should approach the problem as I have never had to link two languages before.
Thanks


I'm working on a library to make that as simple as possible, but it's still an alpha version.

You can also try swig.  It's a tool for generating interfaces to several scripting languages from C/C++.

Since Perl is going to be providing the GUI, I'd embed the C++ code into Perl.  Assuming that there's going to be a significant amount of C++ code, I'd put that into a library.  The traditional way of linking that library to Perl is to create a Perl module using XS.  The Tutorial for writing XSUBs and XS language reference manual will help with that.
A somewhat easier way may be to use the Inline module.  I've used Inline::C before, and it worked well, but I've never tried Inline::CPP (the C++ version).  I see it has mixed reviews.

if its a small project, its probably not worth the investment to spend lots of time getting the two languages to talk.  you might consider using a more appropriate tool.  C# will talk to C++ with a lot less pain.

If I was tackling this problem I'd be using TCL/TK to create a GUI and then building a TCL extension in C/C++ that can be called from TCL/TK.  This is one of the things that TCL/TK is really good at (other dynamic languages can do this as well but I like TCL/TK).  You create a shared libray (.so on Unix or .dll on windows) with the C++ bits and they get imported as commands into TCL when you load the library.
Swig, which has already been mentioned, is a tool that helps automate the wrapping process, it can take your C++ code and create a wrapper that allows it to be loaded into a number languages such as TCL, Perl, Python, Ruby ... 
Start at http://www.tcl.tk/ for lots of informtion an TCL and TK.
