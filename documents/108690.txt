Do you use TestLink and are you happy with it?
testing
In our project, we use this software for test management. What is your experience with this software ? Does it scale correctly with thousands of tests ? 


I used it a while back and liked it, but I didn't have thousands of tests.

I have been looking this software over for awhile. I really find the simplicity good but I can't seem to get a handle on the flow of things.
Everything I know about testing and projects would say the structure should be project -> Requirements -> Test Plan -> Test Cases but with this software it appears to be Test plans / Requirements -> Test Cases and there is no project per say.
 This very confusing to me anyway. Jeff

I am using Testlink and it is amazing.
Using Testlink we can create a project and trace the project's development cycle.
we can do the following this in Testlink:

Create projects
Create requirements
Import requirements
Export requirements
Create test cases and test plan
Assign testcases to requirements
Analyze the requirements to figure the test cases coverage
Import test cases
Export test cases
Execute the test cases
assign bugs to the test cases (If your Testlink is integrated with a bug tracking tool like Mantis, Bugzilla, Jira etc.. )
Create reports

It is very useful for traceability. 
Let me know if you need any help regarding Testlink.
