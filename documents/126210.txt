The Clean programming language in the real world?
functional-programming clean-language
Are there any real world applications written in the Clean programming language? Either open source or proprietary.


http://clean.cs.ru.nl/Projects page doesn't look promising :) It looks like just another research project with no real-world use to date.

This is not a direct answer, but when I checked last time (and I find the language very interesting) I didn't find anything ready for real-world.
The idealist in myself always wants to try out new languagages, very hot on my list (apart from the aforementioned very cool Clean Language) is currently (random order) IO, Fan and Scala...
But in the meantime I then get my pragmatism out and check the Tiobe Index. I know you can discuss it, but still: It tells me what I will be able to use in a year from now and what I possibly won't be able to use...
No pun intended!

I am using Clean together with the iTasks library to build websites quite easy around workflows.
But I guess another problem with Clean is the lack of documentation and examples: "the Clean book" is from quite a few years back, and a lot of new features don't get documented except for the papers they publish.

As one of my professors at college has been involved in the creation of Clean, it was no shock  he'd created a real world application. The rostering-program of our university was created entirely in Clean.

The Clean IDE and the Clean compiler are written in Clean. (http://wiki.clean.cs.ru.nl/Download_Clean)

Cloogle, the unofficial Clean search engine (like Hoogle for Haskell) is written in Clean. Its source is on GitHub.
