Is there an ASP.NET pagination control (Not MVC)?
asp.net pagination
I've got a search results page that basically consists of a repeater with content in it.  What I need is a way to paginate the results.  Getting paginated results isn't the problem, what I'm after is a web control that will display a list of the available paged data, preferably by providing the number of results and a page size


Repeaters don't do this by default.
However, GridViews do.
Personally, I hate GridViews, so I wrote a Paging/Sorting Repeater control.
Basic Steps:

Subclass the Repeater Control
Add a private PagedDataSource to it
Add a public PageSize property
Override Control.DataBind

Store the Control.DataSource in the PagedDataSource.
Bind the Control.DataSource to PagedDataSource

Override Control.Render

Call Base.Render()
Render your paging links.
