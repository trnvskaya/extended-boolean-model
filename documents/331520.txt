How to fix "Referenced assembly does not have a strong name" error?
c# visual-studio-2005 assemblies signing
I've added a weakly named assembly to my Visual Studio 2005 project (which is strongly named). I'm now getting the error:

"Referenced assembly 'xxxxxxxx' does not have a strong name"

Do I need to sign this third-party assembly?


To avoid this error you could either:

Load the assembly dynamically, or
Sign the third-party assembly. 

You will find instructions on signing third-party assemblies in .NET-fu: Signing an Unsigned Assembly (Without Delay Signing). 
Signing Third-Party Assemblies
The basic principle to sign a thirp-party is to 

Disassemble the assembly using ildasm.exe and save the intermediate language (IL):
ildasm /all /out=thirdPartyLib.il thirdPartyLib.dll 

Rebuild and sign the assembly:
ilasm /dll /key=myKey.snk thirdPartyLib.il


Fixing Additional References
The above steps work fine unless your third-party assembly (A.dll) references another library (B.dll) which also has to be signed. You can disassemble, rebuild and sign both A.dll and B.dll using the commands above, but at runtime, loading of B.dll will fail because A.dll was originally built with a reference to the unsigned version of B.dll. 
The fix to this issue is to patch the IL file generated in step 1 above. You will need to add the public key token of B.dll to the reference. You get this token by calling 
sn -Tp B.dll 

which will give you the following output:
Microsoft (R) .NET Framework Strong Name Utility  Version 4.0.30319.33440

Public key (hash algorithm: sha1):
002400000480000094000000060200000024000052534131000400000100010093d86f6656eed3

Public key token is a8a7ed7203d87bc9

The last line contains the public key token. You then have to search the IL of A.dll for the reference to B.dll and add the token as follows:
.assembly extern /*23000003*/ Eurolook.Common
{
  .publickeytoken = (A8 A7 ED 72 03 D8 7B C9 )                         
  .ver 10:0:0:0
}


You can use unsigned assemblies if your assembly is also unsigned.

Expand the project file that is using the project that does not "have a strong name key" and look for the .snk file (.StrongNameKey).
Browse through to this file in Windows Explorer (just so that you know where it is).
Back in Visual Studio in the project that does not "have a strong name key", do

Right click on the project file
Select Properties
Select "Signing tab" (on the left)
Click the check box "Sign the assembly"
Then &ltBrowse> to the .snk file you found earlier

That should do the trick. This solved a problem for me for one project using a form inside another project in the same solution.
I hope it helps.

I had this issue for an app that was strongly named then had to change it in order to reference a non-strongly named assembly, so I unchecked 'Sign the assembly' in the project properties Signing section but it still complained. I figured it had to be an artifact somewhere causing the problem since I did everything else correctly and it was just that. I found and removed the line:  [assembly: AssemblyKeyFile("yourkeyfilename.snk")] from its assemblyInfo.cs file. 
Then no build complaints after that.

I have written a tool to automatically strong-name sign assemblies including ones you do not have the source code for or projects that have been abandoned. It uses many of the techniques described in the answers in a simple way without any of the flaws or drawbacks of existing tools or dated instructions.

Hope this helps out anyone that need to sign a third party assembly without having to jump through hoops to get there.

I was searching for solution to the very same problem and unticking "sing the assembly" options works for me:

(as you may notice screenshot comes from VS2010 but hopefully it will help someone)

Signing the third party assembly worked for me:

Removing the "Sign the assembly" check mark under the "Signing" tab works as @Michal Stefanow said.
Add here is the simplest way to sign your own files and/or other people's files.  You just need to add this line under the "Post-build event command line":
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0A\bin\signtool.exe" sign /f "$(ProjectDir)\YourPfxFileNameHere.pfx" /p YourPfxFilePasswordHere /d "Your software title here" /du http://www.yourWebsiteHere.com /t http://timestamp.verisign.com/scripts/timstamp.dll /v "$(BaseOutputPath)$(TargetFileName)"

You can sign other people's files or your own files and as many as you want.


How to sign an unsigned third-party assembly

Open up Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio. This tool is available in your Window programs and can be found using the default Windows search.
Ensure your prompt has access to the following tools by executing them once: sn ildasm and ilasm
Navigate to the folder where your Cool.Library.dll is located
sn âk Cool.Library.snk to create a new key pair
ildasm Cool.Library.dll /out:Cool.Library.il to disassemble the library
move Cool.Library.dll Cool.Library.unsigned.dll to keep the original library as a back-up
ilasm Cool.Library.il /dll /resource=Cool.Library.res /key=Cool.Library.snk to reassemble the library with a strong name
powershell -command "& {[System.Reflection.AssemblyName]::GetAssemblyName($args).FullName} Cool.Library.dll" to get the assembly fully qualified name. You will need this bit if you have to reference the DLL in external configuration files like web.config or app.config. 


Sometime it may be possible that cmd can not find the proper path for ildsm and ilasm and You may face issues and may get confused.Then you will have to give full path for all of them.to get the full path use cmd.

For me my issue was that I had two of the same NuGet Packages installed with different Versions.
