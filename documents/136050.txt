Prevent visual studio creating browse info (.ncb) files
c++ visual-studio visual-studio-2008
Is there a way to prevent VS2008 creating browse info file files for C++ projects.
I rarely use the class browser and it isn't worth the time it takes to recreate it after every build, especially since it runs even if the build failed.
EDIT - it's also needed for go to declaration/definition


In the project properties, you will find the browse information under:
Configuration Properties -> C/C++ -> Browse Information
Just tell it not to generate browse information.  All it is used for is quickly browsing between code components (like using 'Go to Definition') and so forth.  I personally like being able to quickly jump between the components, but if it is adding unnecessary time to your compile don't worry about turning it off.

Try creating a folder with the same name of the ncb file (you'll have to delete the file, of course). I used this trick in the past to prevent intellisense from locking VS2005. You'll lose intellisense, though.

There is a registry key for this as well: [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\9.0\Languages\Language Services\C/C++]
Intellisense ON
"IntellisenseOptions"=dword:00000000

Intellisense OFF
"IntellisenseOptions"=dword:00000007

Intellisense ON - NO Background UPDATE
"IntellisenseOptions"=dword:00000005

More flags are available and you can Control Intellisense through Macros as well.
ISENSE_NORMAL = 0       'normal (Intellisense On)
ISENSE_NOBG = &H1       'no bg parsing (Intellisense Updating Off - although NCB file will be opened r/w and repersisted at shutdown)
ISENSE_NOQUERY = &H2    'no queries (don't run any ISense queries)
ISENSE_NCBRO = &H4      'no saving of NCB (must be set before opening NCB, doesn't affect updating or queries, just persisting of NCB)
ISENSE_OFF = &H7
