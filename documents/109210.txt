PHP GD, imagecreatefromstring( ); how to get the image dimensions?
php image upload gd
Normally I use imagecreatefromjpeg() and then getimagesize(), but with Firefox 3 I need to go round this different. So now im using imagecreatefromstring(), but how do I retreive the image dimensions now?


imagesx() and imagesy() functions seem to work with images made with imagecreatefromstring(), too.

ah yes! i just found the answer on the internet a second ago :)
for those who still interested :
$image = imagecreatefromstring($img_str);
$w = imagesx($image);
$h = imagesy($image);
