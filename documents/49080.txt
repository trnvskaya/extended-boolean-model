What are the best Visual Studio addins?

I currently use Resharper and have for a few years now. I know there are a ton of other useful addins out there but i never seem to have the time to sort through them to see which is worthy of using. So i was hoping some of you would be able to help me do some sorting.

Visual Assist X (various goodies)
Codekana (various goodies, similar to visual assist x)
Viemu (makes the VS editor react like vi)


Check out PhatStudio: free, open source Visual Studio add in.  File navigation by partial file name, header switch, etc.

I love Resharper

VisualJS.NET is a great addin in order to add dynamic forms into a web application.

I'm currently working with code snippets and using snipcode.
I find it's useful, quick in searching and collecting code.
Nice to have.
Enjoy
