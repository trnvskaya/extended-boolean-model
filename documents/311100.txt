Any tool that can upgrade .NET 1.1 WinForm code to .NET 2.0 "style"?
winforms upgrade
I mean a tool that can extract certain contents from old .NET 1.1 WinForm code and put it in .designer file (make it looks like .net 2.0 WinForm code). This also involves an update to the project file (.csproj/.vbproj)..
If no existing tool yet, any tip or pointer on how to do this by programming?


It is possible to do using a macro, have a look at this article for the macro code.
If anyone else is looking to do this for VB.net (as I did) the only example I could find was this one in c# but it gave me a basis and we got it to work with a vb project.
