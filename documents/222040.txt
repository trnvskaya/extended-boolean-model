ASP.NET Tab Controls
asp.net asp.net-ajax
I'm currently attempting to create a tabbed interface in a web application, and based on my search, there aren't any 'built in' tab controls in ASP.NET.  There are some in the ASP.NET AJAX downloadable toolkit, as well as a wealth of 'pay for use' third party Tab Controls.
My question is:  What Tab control have you used for ASP.NET applications, and why do you use it?


You can use MultiView/Views and your own navigation to get tabs in ASP.NET. 

I've used the AJAX TabControl in the past and I like it.  It's pretty straight forward.  It's easy enough to get to the active tab and its content.

I have used the Rad TabStrip control by Telerik and it is one of the best to work with in my opinion.

We use multiviews most of the time, or, in some cases, we build our own tab controls out of a combination of link buttons and overlapping panels and swap their visibilities based on what link button has been pressed (this may seem primative, but it works well).
