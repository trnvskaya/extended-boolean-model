Prototype get by tag function
javascript prototypejs
How do I get an element or elementlist by it's tag name. Take for example that I want all elements from <h1></h1>


document.getElementsByTagName('a') returns an array. Look here for more information: http://developer.mozilla.org/En/DOM/Element.getElementsByTagName

Use $$() and pass in a CSS selector.
Read the Prototype API documentation for $$()
This gives you more power beyond just tag names. You can select by class, parent/child relationships, etc. It supports more CSS selectors than the common browser can be expected to.

Matthias Kestenholz:
getElementsByTagName returns a NodeList object, which is array-like but is not an array, it's a live list.
var test = document.getElementsByTagName('a');
alert(test.length); // n
document.body.appendChild(document.createElement('a'));
alert(test.length); // n + 1


If you use getElementsByTagName, you'll need to wrap it in $A() to return an Array.  However, you can simply do $$('a') as nertzy suggested. 

You could also use $$(tag-name)[n] to get specific element from the collection.
