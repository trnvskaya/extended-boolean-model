Is there a free (LGPL, BSD, etc) implementation of XML editor swing component
java swing
I need a JComponent thad enables editing xml documents so I can embed it in my application.
It doesnt need to bee fancy.
Plain text editing and highlighting would bee enough.
Thank in advance


Maybe this Xml Editor would do:

I had to enhance and restructure my XML Editor to make it a "plugable" JPanel.

Otherwise, you still have the SimpleEditor.java which might be as good.
