Apache + mod_lisp + clisp
apache lisp clisp
How to to configure apache + mod_lisp + clisp and set up a "Hello World!"? I couldn't find any complete howto on the subject. Thanks.
Edit: Vebjorn's solution works, but then I don't how to code the "hello world!". Can anyone tell me how to proceed? There's something like SWANKing the clisp, then connect to it with SLIME, but then when I launch mod_lisp's demo, the test page is not served and my slime doesn't return?
Thanks again.


This article seems to be a fairly thorough "how-to" guide to set up Common Lisp on Apache using mod_lisp2.

If all has gone as planned, you should now have a Common Lisp app server running behind Apache


What backend are you using? If none, I would suggest trying Hunchentoot or, even better, UCW.
Both of those links will take you to the installation instructions, ending with a Hello World kind of page.


Download http://www.fractalconcept.com:8000/public/open-source/mod_lisp/mod_lisp.c
Compile and install Apache module with sudo apxs -i -c mod_lisp.c
Add the following to your httpd.conf:

LoadModule lisp_module libexec/httpd/mod_lisp.so
AddModule mod_lisp.c
LispServer 127.0.0.1 3000 "foo"
<Location /foo>
  SetHandler lisp-handler
</Location>

Restart apache with sudo apachectl restart
Download example of Lisp-side handling in CLISP: http://www.fractalconcept.com/fcweb/download/modlisp-clisp.lisp
Start CLISP and evaluate:

(load "modlisp-clisp")
(modlisp:modlisp-server)

Point your browser to http://localhost/foo.  You should see:


mod_lisp 2.0
