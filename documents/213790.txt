SVN: Dealing with "dead" files
svn maintenance
I have an SVN repository. Over time, as I edit, modify, change, etc, some files are made redundant/unwanted.
What's the best practice: to delete the files from SVN, or just to zero the files out?
Or is there a third option that I'm missing? 
Thanks. 


If you delete unneeded files from Subversion, they are still available in the history. They don't disappear forever. So I would "svn rm" them.

Delete the file(s):
svn remove <file>

The files will not be permanently removed from the repository, just removed from the HEAD revision.

Committing an empty file would still leave the file to annoy you, just minus any content.  svn rm is the way to go.

As subversion comes out with new releases you may want to do a full repository export(instead of a backup or hotcopy). Install the new release and then do a full repository import.
This will start your revision numbers over and you will loose all history before that export.
