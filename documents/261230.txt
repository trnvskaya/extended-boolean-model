Userland autoboxing?
java autoboxing
Is it possible to implement autoboxing for your own classes?
To illustrate my example, this is what I might want to write:
Foo foo = "lolcat";

And this is what Java would do (as per my own definitions, somewhere, somehow), under the hood:
Foo foo = new Foo();
foo.setLolcat("lolcat");

So, is this possible somehow, or is it a JVM-feature only?


No, java does not support operator overloading (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_overloading).
Autoboxing is a compiler feature and not available for your own classes.
The reasoning is explained here:
