In SQL*Plus, how do I change the prompt to show the connected user and database?
oracle sqlplus
To show, for example....
USER@SID >

I thought this was potentially helpful to a few people so I'm going to answer it too!


Amend your $ORACLE_HOME\sqlplus\admin\glogin.sql script - add:
set sqlprompt "_user '@' _connect_identifier > "

to the end of the file.
In Oracle 10g this will change correctly each time you issue a "conn".  For clients before 10g it won't change when you do a "conn" but will remain as the username/db you first connected to.
You can also use _date for the current date and _privilege for the privilege (eg SYSDBA) of the connected user.
