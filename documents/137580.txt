How can I perform a HEAD request with the mechanize library?
python http-headers mechanize
I know how to do a HEAD request with httplib, but I have to use mechanize for this site. 
Essentially, what I need to do is grab a value from the header (filename) without actually downloading the file.
Any suggestions how I could accomplish this?


Mechanize itself only sends GETs and POSTs, but you can easily extend the Request class to send HEAD. Example:
import mechanize

class HeadRequest(mechanize.Request):
    def get_method(self):
        return "HEAD"

request = HeadRequest("http://www.example.com/")
response = mechanize.urlopen(request)

print response.info()


In mechanize there is no need to do HeadRequest class etc.
Simply

import mechanize

br = mechanize.Browser()

r = br.open("http://www.example.com/")

print r.info()


That's all.
