Learning Anaysis Services
sql-server reporting-services ssas cubes
Can anyone recommend a good resource -- book, website, article, etc -- to help me learn SQL Server Analysis services.
I have no knowledge of this technology right now but I do constantly work with SQL server in the traditional sense. 
I want to learn about Cubes and Using Reporting Services with it. I want to start from the bottom but after I finish with the material, ideally, I'd be able to stumble through a real development project...
I'm hoping to get started with a free resource but if anyone knows of a really good book, I'd take that too.
Or, if you don't know of a resource how did you get started with the technology?
Thank you,
Frank


Here's a link to Analysis Services Books online.  It's a decent resource, and completely free.  

Pretty outstanding book:
Professional SQL Server Analysis Services 2005 with MDX
Gives you a good overview of the architecture of SSAS, as well as the query language MDX, and administrative/maintenance overview.  A good primer for a developer OR a system administrator.

My personal favorite book on the topic is Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Analysis Services
Mosha Pasumansky's blog is a great resource once you start learning more about the technology and MDX
