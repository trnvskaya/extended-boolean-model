What is the correct LINQtoSQL-ish way to do a table truncate?
linq-to-sql tsql data-access-layer truncate
I have a project with a formidable data access layer using LinqtoSQL for just about anything touching our databases. I needed to build a helper class that bridges some common crud operations from CLSA objects to LinqToSql ones. Everything has been operating swimmingly until I needed to do a truncate on a table and all I had were âdeleteâ methods.
Uh-oh. A quick search reveals that some people are using YourContext.ExecuteCommand(), which is nice and all, but I am trying to go ât-sql-lessâ as much as possible these days.
Is there a LINQ way to perform a truncate on a table? Or am I just clueless?


This is not possible without doing a custom T-SQL query. Doing a .Delete() and SubmitChanges afterwords would, as you probably already know, result in a DELETE statement.
Of course you could create a stored procedure that truncates the table, and then call the procedure from LINQ, but that isn't really what you're looking for I believe.

You can do something like this:
yourDataContext.ExecuteCommand("TRUNCATE TABLE YourTable");
