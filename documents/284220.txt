Iterate though Generic List in C#
c# generics
public class Item
{
        private int  _rowID;
        private Guid _itemGUID;

        public Item() { }

        public int Rid
        {
            get
            {
                return _rowID;
            }
            set {  }

        }

        public Guid IetmGuid
        {
            get
            {
                return _itemGuid;
            }
            set
            {
                _itemGuid= value;
            }

        }

}

The above is my custom object.
I have a list:
List<V> myList = someMethod;

where V is of type Item, my object.
I want to iterate and get the properties as such
foreach(V element in mylist)
{
   Guid test = element.IetmGuid; 
}

When I debug and look at the 'element' object I can see all the properties in the 'Quickwatch' but I cannot do element.IetmGuid.


foreach( object element in myList ) {
    Item itm = element as Item;
    if ( null == itm ) { continue; }
    Guid test = itm.ItemGuid;
}


Your list should be declared like this:
List<V> myList = someMethod;

Where V is the type item.
and then your iteration was correct:
foreach(V element in myList)
{
    Guid test = element.IetmGuid;
}


Try declaring your list like this:
List<Item> myList = someMethod;


Are you putting a constraint on the generic type V?  You'll need to tell the runtime that V can be any type that is a subtype of your Item type.
public class MyGenericClass<V>
  where V : Item  //This is a constraint that requires type V to be an Item (or subtype)
{
  public void DoSomething()
  {
    List<V> myList = someMethod();

    foreach (V element in myList)
    {
      //This will now work because you've constrained the generic type V
      Guid test = element.IetmGuid;
    }
  }
}

Note, it only makes sense to use a generic class in this manner if you need to support multiple kinds of Items (represented by subtypes of Item).
