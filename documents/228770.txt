Application_Start works fine on workstation, is not called when deployed
asp.net global-asax application-start
I have an application that works great on my development workstation but fails when the application is deployed to the live environment.  It seems that Application_Start is not being called in the live environment.


I was able to fix it by removing the PrecompiledApp.config file that was in the root directory of the web site on our test server.  I'm guessing that file was a holdover from when the project was a Web Site project.  I recently converted it over to a Web App project.  So if you are building a Web App project, make sure you DON'T have a PrecompiledApp.config file on your target server.
