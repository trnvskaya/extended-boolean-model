Are real-time linux extensions obsolete?
linux kernel real-time
Do the new real-time and low latency patches from Ingo Molnar render previous real-time extensions for Linux (such as RTAI, Xenomai) obsolete?


Doesn't look like it to me, although I've not endeavoured to build a real-time system on Linux (yet).  RTAI look like APIs.  POSIX.4 would be similar (and of course infinitely superior in my humble opinion as the former vice-chair of that committee and author of the book :) .
Molnar's work looks to me as if it is designed to actually provide real-time performance to Linux.  So to write a real, real-time application, you're probably talking about (1) using real-time APIs as well as the standard *nix calls, and (2) building your application very carefully, taking account of techniques mentioned on the Real-Time Linux Wiki.  So in general, I'd say you need both.  And probably even more than those two!
