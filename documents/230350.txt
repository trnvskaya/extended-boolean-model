How to add a dynamic weather ticker to the webpage
language-agnostic
All Weather Tickers I found are static and if the user wants to select a zip code it links you to a different page.
Do you know any weather ticker that just gets the new info  in the same page?


RICO has an AJAX weather widget that seems to be along the lines of what you want.

It's possible to do this yourself - you can generally get this data from the National Weather Service's METARs.  Here's the METAR for the Rochester, NY airport. They're available in all sorts of ways (XML, FTP), and there are lots of parsers out there.
