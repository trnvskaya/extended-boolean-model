Hooking up Reporting Services 2005SP2 to SQL Server 2008
sql-server sql-server-2005 sql-server-2008 system-administration
I am trying to configure Reporting Services 2005SP2 on a machine with SQL 2008 on another hosting the ReportServer DB.
When I create the ReportServerDB the DB is created as version C.0.9.45:
When, afterwards, I try to initialise Reporting Services, I get an error about an incorrect version number. Reporting Services created a ReportServer DB version C.0.9.45 but now expects a version C.0.8.54.
Changing compatibility settings of the DB doesnât have an effect. And changing the version number sproc in the DB to return what Reporting Services wants to hear only delays the crash until initialisation has started.
Any ideas?


You must have created the reportServerDB using the SQL 2008 configuration tool. If you want to use the 2005 version of the server you need to create the configuration database using the configuration tool that came with SQL 2005. The 2005 SP2 tool will create a database with version C.0.8.54

I got a reply from microsoft support saying that it is impossible on the same box.
