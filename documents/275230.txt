Excel / Quickbooks data to c#
c# excel import quickbooks
I know how to use the OleDbConnection class to open an excel file and select from it, but is there a simple method to read the data from an excel file that has been read into a Stream? And is there also a similar method for QuickBooks?


Stream? No, Excel files are a complicated mess.  Quickbooks, yeah.  I found this ODBC driver, it should support OdbcDataAdapter.

You can also look at various QuickBooks integration options, which allow you to communicate with QuickBooks via XML requests and responses. More details on the QuickBooks SDK here:
