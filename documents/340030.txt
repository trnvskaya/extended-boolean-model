Firefox manipulation of saved form data
forms firefox
Is there a Firefox plugin for manipulating and deleting saved form data?
In the browser there is only the option to delete all data.


You can use the SQLite Manager to access the form history database directly. Just select the profile formhistory.sqlite.

I am using FFv 3.0.4.
Using Tools -> Clear Private Data,
invoke a pop-up.
From the pop-up dialog, you can decide what to clear
[] Browsing History [] Download History [] Saved Form and Search History <------ you are interested in this [] Cache [] Cookies [] Offline Saved data [] saved password [] authenticated session
hope this ans your question

Form History Control does what you want.
