Unit testing CLI/MFC Application
visual-studio visual-studio-2008 unit-testing mfc c++-cli
I have CLI/MFC application and I would like to begin to learn how to unit test with it.  I have VS2008 Pro.  If possible, I would like to use the built in unit testing.  Thanks for your input!


I've had success with both CPPUnit and Google Test.  For either you have to do a bit of work to get the test results to integrate back into Studio.  The granularity of the results you want directly affects how much work.  Do you want a pass/fail for the whole test set, or individual results?  The former is a simple msbuild task, the latter requires outputting the result set to XML, massaging that with a transform, then pulling it back in.

We use Gallio & MbUnit to test our MFC & C++/CLI application. Simply write the tests in C++/CLI then you can test both managed and unmanged code in a single framework. We also use NMock2 for mocking the managed code.

If you have Team Test edition, you can use it to test C++/CLI applications and libraries. See here.
