Good examples or documentation of XIFF implementation?
flex actionscript-3 actionscript xmpp xiff
XIFF is an implemenation of the XMPP protocol in actionscript.
So far, all the examples and documentation I have seen are sparse. Does anyone know a good explanation of the most recent version of XIFF and/or good examples of working Flex/AIR applications? 


Yeah, there are not a ton of good examples / docs online.
