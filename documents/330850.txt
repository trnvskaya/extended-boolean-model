How do I add HTML links in C# TextBox?
c# html textbox hyperlink
How can I put a link in a C# TextBox?  I have tried to put HTML tags in the box but instead of showing a link it shows the entire HTML tag.  Can this be done with a TextBox?


To my knowledge not with the standard textbox.  You'd have to create your own.  One option it the Telerik controls, they're a little pricey for individual development, but very robust and configurable.

I would try using an editable div and making it look like a text box. This would allow you to get user input and use links.
To make this easier, try JEditable.

Use the RichTextBox, no need to build your own, it cames with VS

I would think about this a little bit. If you allow executable code in an editable control, the user, the user can execute ANY code. This is generally a bad idea.
The behavior of the C# control is intentional to prevent the exact behavior that you are trying to create. A little creativity (such as parsing out links from the text box and creating a list of links next or below the text box) will provide a much safer application.

Are we talking about ASP.NET or Windows Forms?

If that is in windows forms and you really can't use the richtextbox, you can create a control with a linklabel inside of textbox.

For windows application, we can use a webbrowser control. However, for web applications Freetextbox will do the job.This is freely available dll.
