AJAX console window with ANSI/VT100 support?
python ajax vt100
I'm planning to write gateway web application, which would need "terminal window" with VT100/ANSI escape code support. Are there any AJAX based alternatives for such a task?
I'm thinking something like this: http://tryruby.hobix.com/
My preferred backend for the system is Python/Twisted/Pylons, but since I'm just planning, I will explore every option.


AjaxTerm has a terminal, with mostly felicitous terminal emulation, done on the Python backend (it just pushes display updates to the client Javascript).
The AjaxTerm website has been down for some time, but you can still find it packaged in Debian.

Try
AnyTerm
AjaxTerm
WebShell

There's also Shell In A Box.
