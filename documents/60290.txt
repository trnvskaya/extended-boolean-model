Can I change the appearance of an html image during hover without a second image?
html css image
Is there a way to change the appearance of an icon (ie. contrast / luminosity) when I hover the cursor, without requiring a second image file (or without requiring a hidden portion of the image)?


The way I usually see things done with smaller images such as buttons it that only a certain portion of the image is shown. Then many states of the picture will make up a larger picture which gets shifted around behind the visible port. I'll delete this when someone has code.

Here's some good information about image opacity and transparency with CSS.
So to make an image with opacity 50%, you'd do this:
<img src="image.png" style="opacity: 0.5; filter: alpha(opacity=50)" />

The opacity: part is how Firefox does it, and it's a value between 0.0 and 1.0. filter: is how IE does it, and it's a value from 0 to 100.

You don't use an img tag, but an element with a background-image css attribute and set the background-position on hover.  IE requires an 'a' tag as a parent element for the :hover selector.  They are called css sprites.
A great article explaining how to use CSS sprites.

here's some code to play with. basic idea: put all possible states of the picture into one big image; set a "window size", that's smaller then the image; move the window around using background-position
<style type="text/css" media="screen">
   #test {
       display: block; width: 250px; height: 337px; /* window size */
       background: url(http://vi.sualize.us/thumbs/08/09/01/fashion,indie,inspiration,portrait-f825c152cc04c3dbbb6a38174a32a00f_h.jpg) no-repeat; /* put the image */
       border: 1px solid red; /* for debugging */
       text-indent: -1000px; /* hide the text */
   }
   #test:hover {
       background-position: -250px 0px; /* on mouse over move the window to a different part of the image */
   }
</style>

<a href="#" id="test">a button</a>
