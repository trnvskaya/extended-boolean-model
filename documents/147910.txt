How to check the overall health of database using Toad?
toad
Anyone have any idea? And any open source sofware which also seens to perform this kind of functionality?


The DBA version of Toad has such a feature. In my version, it is under the DBA menu, and is called "Health Check".

In Toad 11,  Main Menu -> Database -> Diagnose -> DB Health Check. You can learn more about it at ToadWorld, though this may be for a newer version.
