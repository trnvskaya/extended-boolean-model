How to access the layer of a view?
iphone cocoa-touch core-animation
I would like to apply a transformation (rotation) to a UIImageView. I could just set the transform property of the view, but wouldn't setting the layer's transform make it faster? If so, how can I achieve this?
Assuming I have a UIImageView initialized with an image, can anyone help? Wouldn't it be better to have a UIVIew with a UIImageView in it?


If you're doing a simple rotation, the speed difference is probably insignificant, but you can get access to a view's layer by doing:
view.layer 
So, you can just use 
view.layer.affineTransform = newTranform; 

You can do a constant rotation using a CAAnimation that auto repeats (I think; I haven't actually tried to do this exact thing, but similar stuff). 
If one animation won't do it, certainly two will (have one rotate 180Â°, then when it ends, have another one fire to do the second 180Â°. This can be done on either the view or its layer. You'll definitely want to test this on a device for performance.
No need to use NSTimer; this is what CoreAnimation is built for.
