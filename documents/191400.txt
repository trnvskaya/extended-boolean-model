How do I protect all worksheet in an Excel workbook with a single click?
excel excel-vba
I have around 25 worksheets in my workbook (Excel spreadsheet).
Is there a way I can protect all the 25 worksheets in single click ? or this feature is not available and I will have to write a VBA code to accomplish this. I need very often to protect all sheets and unprotect all sheets and doing individually is time consuming


I don't believe there's a way to do it without using VBA.  If you are interested in a VBA solution, here is the code:
Dim ws as Worksheet
Dim pwd as String

pwd = "" ' Put your password here
For Each ws In Worksheets
    ws.Protect Password:=pwd
Next ws

Unprotecting is virtually the same:
Dim ws as Worksheet
Dim pwd as String

pwd = "" ' Put your password here
For Each ws In Worksheets
    ws.Unprotect Password:=pwd
Next ws


Don't think there's a button to do it, but it's simple enough code:
For Each protSheet In Worksheets
  protSheet.Protect Password := "boo"
Next protSheet

You can protect the workbook rather than each sheet and this will stop changes being made across the entire workbook

You can protect all worksheets from user changes but still allow VBA scripts to make changes with the "UserInterfaceOnly" option.  This workaround lets you run any VBA script on the worksheets without having to protect and unprotect each time:
Dim ws as Worksheet
Dim pwd as String

pwd = "" ' Put your password here
or Each ws In Worksheets
   ws.Protect Password:=pwd, UserInterfaceOnly:=True
Next ws

Unprotecting is the same as the solution offered by Ben Hoffstein:
Dim ws as Worksheet
Dim pwd as String

pwd = "" ' Put your password here
For Each ws In Worksheets
    ws.Unprotect Password:=pwd
Next ws

You can access this macro with a button/shortcut.  In Excel 2010 you right-click on the Quick Access toolbar and select "Customize Quick Access Toolbar".  In the drop down menu to choose commands, select "Macros".  Then click the VBA script you created to protect (or unprotect).  Finally click the "Add > >" button and then "OK" to save it.
