I am currently writting a programe about Conway's Game of life and I am really a beginner of python, I don't know how to start at all. Anybody can help me with it?

These are places where you can hire people to do small freelance work for you.

You probably don't need to pay to learn python. Implementing cellular automata makes for good starting project.  The best place to start with python is the official tutorial and you can follow that with dive into python.
The answers here and here may be helpful as well.
If you can bear the self-praising and claims to godness Wolfram's book is a good way to get a feel for cellular automata, but don't take the book itself too seriously (that's a separate issue that can fill several blog posts). He also has a set of papers on this stuff that is published as a book that goes into all the details.  And of course if you just google for cellular automata and Conway's game you'll find a myriad of implementations and explanations.

There's a few people on the pygame.org website who've done their versions of the game of life. Maybe they'll be of help:
Pygame.org - search "life"

You'll probably get some good documentation here : http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085959/.

I happened to post a blog on implementing John Conway's Game of Life in XAML/WPF using embedded Python.  It might be of interest to you.
