Enable ListView multiselect by dragging
wpf xaml listview multi-select
How do I enable multi-select in a WPF ListView by dragging? 
Setting the SelectionMode property to Extended does allow multi-select using Shift and Ctrl, but not by clicking and dragging. Setting the SelectionMode property to Multiple gives a sticky selection which isn't what I want.


You could extend ListView and ListViewItem to implement click and drag multi-select behavior.
