How to configure CruiseControl.NET to build one project on a remote server
cruisecontrol.net build-server
I have a build server running CruiseControl.NET. It works well for the 7 projects that are configured to run on that server (let's call it server A).
Now I have a new project that I wish to build on a different server (server B), but I want it to appear in the same ccnet dashboard as the existing projects. 
How do I configure CCNet for this scenario?


In dashboard.config (default location is c:\Program Files\CruiseControl.NET\webdashboard\dashboard.config) take a look at the Servers Configuration Block:
   <servers>
       <server name="local" url="tcp://localhost:21234/CruiseManager.rem"
               allowForceBuild="true" allowStartStopBuild="true" />
   </servers>

It allows you to configure the remote servers you want to report on - just add another <server /> node.
To force the changes to appear on your CruiseControl.NET dashboard, edit the web.config file in the same folder and save it. Refresh the dashboard web page.

Duckworth's answer is the one I found via Google. I found the complete story (identifying all protagonists) as:
Open the dashboard.config file. Its default location is \Program Files\CruiseControl.NET\webdashboard. 
At the top of dashboard.config, add the extra server. Eg


and save the changes.
