How to add a new SharePoint alert via Web Services
sharepoint alerts
I found the Alert Service but it only seems to have methods for Getting and Deleting.  How do I add a new alert?


After some better searching I found this:

AFAIK there is no web service available that will allow you to add or 
edit alerts so I think you have two options.
