A free tool to check C/C++ source code against a set of coding standards?
c++ c coding-style
It looks quite easy to find such a tool for Java (Checkstyle, JCSC), but I can't seem to find one for C/C++. I am not looking for a lint-like static code analyzer, I only would like to check against coding standards like variable naming, capitalization, spacing, identation, bracket placement, and so on.


The only tool I know is Vera. Haven't used it, though, so can't comment how viable it is. Demo looks promising.

I have used a tool in my work its LDRA tool suite
It is used for testing the c/c++ code but it also can check against coding standards such as MISRA etc.

There's a list.  There is also a putative C++ frontend on splint.

Not exactly what you ask for, but I've found it easier to just all agree on a coding standard astyle can generate and then automate the process.

Check universalindentgui on sourceforge.net.
it has many style checkers for C and you can customise the checkers.

I'm sure this could help to some degree cxx checker. Also this tool seems to be pretty good KWStyle It's from Kitware, the guys who develop Cmake. 

I'm currently working on a project with another project to write just such a tool. I looked at other static code analysis tools and decided that I could do better. 
Unfortunately, the project is not yet ready to be used without fairly intimate knowledge of the code (read: it's buggy as all hell). However, we're moving fairly quickly, and hope to have a beta release within the next 8 weeks.
The project is open source - you can visit the project page, and if you want to get involved, we'd love some more external input. 
I won't bore you with the details - you can visit the project page for that, but I will say one thing: Most static code analysis tools are aimed at checking your code for mistakes, and not very concerned with checking for coding guidelines. We have taken a more flexible approach that allows us to write plugiins to check for both "house rules" as well as possible bugs.
If you want any more information, please don't hesitate to contact me.
Cheers,

Google c++lint from  Google code style guide.

There is cppcheck which is supported also by Hudson via the plugin of the same name.

Try nsiqcppstyle. It's a Python based coding style checker for C/C++. It's easy to extend to add your own rules.

Check Metrix++ http://metrixplusplus.sourceforge.net/. It may require some extensions which are specific for your needs.
