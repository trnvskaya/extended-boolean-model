C++ Coding Guideline 102
c++ coding-style
If you were allowed to add another coding guideline to the 101 guidelines of the "C++ coding standards" (Herb Sutter and Andrei Alexandrescu), which would you add?


I vote for: "avoid considering goto, naming notation and indentation as being the subjects of coding rules"

Write for a year later.

Rule 102: Any change to expected functionality should result in a regression test that fails.

"Use RAII judiciously"

Prefer constructors to init()/setup() functions.
Why manipulating an object that may be in an unusable state? Isn't it better to not have it at all ?
