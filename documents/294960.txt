Pycurl WRITEDATA WRITEFUNCTION collision/crash
python crash libcurl pycurl
How do I turnoff WRITEFUNCTION and WRITEDATA?
Using pycurl I have a class call curlUtil. In it I have pageAsString (self, URL) which returns a string. 
To do this I setopt WRITEFUNCTION. Now in downloadFile (self, URL, fn, overwrite=0) I do an open and self.c.Setopt (pycurl.WRITEFUNCTION, 0) which cause problems. Int is not a valid argument. 
I then assumed WRITEDATA would overwrite the value or there would be a NOWRITEFUNCTION commend. NOWRITEFUNCTION didn't exist so I just used WRITEDATA and Python crashed. 
I wrote a quick func called reboot() which closes curl, opens it again, and calls reset to put it in the default state. I call it in both pageAsString and downloadFile and there is no problem at all. But, I don't want to reinitialize curl. There might be some special options I set.

using the writefunction, instead of turning it off would save you a lot off trouble. you might want to rewrite your pageAsString by utilizing WRITEFUNCTION..
as an example: 
from cStringIO import StringIO
c = pycurl.Curl()
buffer = StringIO()
c.setopt(pycurl.WRITEFUNCTION, buffer.write)
c.setopt(pycurl.URL, "http://example.com")
c.perform()
...
buffer.getvalue() # will return the data fetched.
