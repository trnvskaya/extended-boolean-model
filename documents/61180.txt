Web in a desktop application: Good web browser controls?
browser controls desktop-application
I've been utlising a "web browser control" in desktop based applications (in my case Windows Forms .NET) for a number of years.  I mostly use it to create a familiar flow-based user interface that also allows a seamless transition to the internet where required.
I'm really tired of the IE browser control because of the poor quality html it generates on output.  Also,  I guess that it is really just IE7 behind the scenes and so has many of that browser "issues".  Despite this, it is quite a powerful control and provides rich interaction with your desktop app.
So, what other alternatives to the IE browser control are there?  I looked at a Mosaic equivalent a year ago but was disappointed with the number of unimplemented features, maybe this has improved recently?


hmm..Interestingly 

Mozilla seems to provide ActiveX control
K-Melon is another Gecko based browser control


Popular layout engines:

Mozilla Gecko
KHTML
WebKit (based on KHTML)

Though I'm not sure how easy it is to embed those in a .Net app.
