JQuery: Current, Well-Formatted, Printable Documentation?
jquery
I'm looking for a current (1.2), well-formatted, printable version of the jQuery documentation.  I've checked the alternative resources page and see the PDF versions from CF and Java, but both are out of date.
The jQuery site has the API browser with "Printable Version" in the toolbox, but it prints terribly, and I don't really want to print one page or tab at a time.
I have a hard time believing that there is no print doc for a tool this popular - all I want is a simple listing with descriptions and examples ON PAPER.
Am I missing something?
I can buy one of the books if I need to, but not sure which is for the current version.
Thanks!

Update:
I can see that somebody voted this down.  I know it's a pretty basic question, but it is not asked lightly or frivolously.  I have made a pretty solid effort to find this on my own, and am pretty good at finding information when I need it.
Perhaps the person who thought the question not worth asking knows where to find the print doc?

It's not documentation but if the Print functionality in your browser while viewing the tutorials and references on the jQuery site doesn't suffice then these books most certainly will.

There are many good jQuery cheat sheets on the Web. Here is one...

One of these, the Manning book previously referenced, and the excellent online docs make you an expert pretty quickly.

The last time I checked, all of the printable jQuery documentation is out of date. There is one for v1.1 available here:
http://www.bennadel.com/blog/544-Printing-The-Entire-jQuery-API-As-A-PDF-Using-CFDocument-And-XML-Parsing-.htm
I don't know of any up-to-date versions of the documentation though.

Yeah i also disappointed with manning jquery in action book, learning jquery by packt is much better but still not covered most common needs, probably john resig need to write a book himself.

take a look at this page.
it has compiled html help file (CHM) for latest jQuery 1.3.
that guy also compiles another useful CHM manuals.

I personally use and prefer: http://colorcharge.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/jquery12_colorcharge.png

You could also do a little work yourself by usng a service like PediaPress which specializes in converting MediaWiki data to print form.
The jQuery API is all MediaWiki that you could write a simple scraper to gather (just look at the "Edit" pages).
PediaPress has some code to parse the MediaWiki written in Python. With that, you can transform the material however you wish.

http://api.jquery.com/ is the best reference I've come across, it also has a downloadable app at the bottom that installs as an Adobe AIR application...very handy.

From 
http://roshanbh.com.np/2008/03/jquery-benefits-examples-free-ebook.html you can download a chm, and print it. The link is at the end of the entry.

Here are some jQuery cheat sheets available in multiple printable formats with descriptions and examples on usages.

new ansewr, since this is such an old post, and was the only post i found on this here, http://www.bennadel.com/resources/uploads/jquery_documentation.pdf
