Considering N2 CMS but worried about performance. Is this justified?
asp.net performance .net-3.5 content-management-system n2
Hy, does anyone worked with N2 Content Management System(http://www.codeplex.com/n2).
If yes, how does it perform, performance wise(under heavy load)?
It seems pretty simple and easy to use.

Maybe try this question at http://www.codeplex.com/n2/Thread/List.aspx
They might be able to tell you about performance limitations or bottlenecks.

I tried it and it looked promising at first but quickly had issues actually deploying it to a Medium Trust host.

http://whocanhelpme.codeplex.com/ and http://www.fancydressoutfitters.co.uk/ are n2cms based.

i have 2 high traffic web sites both using N2 CMS, its fast and reliable

We've built numerous sites in N2 and we love it.
Many of these sites have in excess of 20,000 users accessing on a daily basis.  We've also load tested up to 50,000 users with no problems.
It's running on fairly modest hardware - one web server, one db server.
With caching enabled it is extremly fast, as the database hardly gets hit!
