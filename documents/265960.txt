Best way to strip punctuation from a string in Python
python string punctuation
It seems like there should be a simpler way than:
import string
s = "string. With. Punctuation?" # Sample string 
out = s.translate(string.maketrans("",""), string.punctuation)

Is there?


Not necessarily simpler, but a different way, if you are more familiar with the re family. 
import re, string
s = "string. With. Punctuation?" # Sample string 
out = re.sub('[%s]' % re.escape(string.punctuation), '', s)


Do search and replace using the regex functions, as seen here.. If you have to repeatedly perform the operation, you can keep a compiled copy of the regex pattern (your punctuation) around, which will speed things up a bit.

I usually use something like this:
>>> s = "string. With. Punctuation?" # Sample string
>>> import string
>>> for c in string.punctuation:
...     s= s.replace(c,"")
...
>>> s
'string With Punctuation'


From an efficiency perspective, you're not going to beat translate() - it's performing raw string operations in C with a lookup table - there's not much that will beat that but writing your own C code.
If speed isn't a worry, another option though is:
exclude = set(string.punctuation)
s = ''.join(ch for ch in s if ch not in exclude)

This is faster than s.replace with each char, but won't perform as well as non-pure python approaches such as regexes or string.translate, as you can see from the below timings.  For this type of problem, doing it at as low a level as possible pays off.
Timing code:
import re, string, timeit

s = "string. With. Punctuation"
exclude = set(string.punctuation)
table = string.maketrans("","")
regex = re.compile('[%s]' % re.escape(string.punctuation))

def test_set(s):
    return ''.join(ch for ch in s if ch not in exclude)

def test_re(s):  # From Vinko's solution, with fix.
    return regex.sub('', s)

def test_trans(s):
    return s.translate(table, string.punctuation)

def test_repl(s):  # From S.Lott's solution
    for c in string.punctuation:
        s=s.replace(c,"")
    return s

print "sets      :",timeit.Timer('f(s)', 'from __main__ import s,test_set as f').timeit(1000000)
print "regex     :",timeit.Timer('f(s)', 'from __main__ import s,test_re as f').timeit(1000000)
print "translate :",timeit.Timer('f(s)', 'from __main__ import s,test_trans as f').timeit(1000000)
print "replace   :",timeit.Timer('f(s)', 'from __main__ import s,test_repl as f').timeit(1000000)

This gives the following results:
sets      : 19.8566138744
regex     : 6.86155414581
translate : 2.12455511093
replace   : 28.4436721802


myString.translate(None, string.punctuation)


This might not be the best solution however this is how I did it.
import string
f = lambda x: ''.join([i for i in x if i not in string.punctuation])


string.punctuation is ascii ONLY! A more correct (but also much slower) way is to use the unicodedata module:
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
from unicodedata import category
s = u'String â with -  Â«punctation Â»...'
s = ''.join(ch for ch in s if category(ch)[0] != 'P')
print 'stripped', s


I like to use a function like this:
def scrub(abc):
    while abc[-1] is in list(string.punctuation):
        abc=abc[:-1]
    while abc[0] is in list(string.punctuation):
        abc=abc[1:]
    return abc


Regular expressions are simple enough, if you know them. 
import re
s = "string. With. Punctuation?"
s = re.sub(r'[^\w\s]','',s)


For Python 3 str or Python 2 unicode values, str.translate() only takes a dictionary; codepoints (integers) are looked up in that mapping and anything mapped to None is removed.
To remove (some?) punctuation then, use:
import string

remove_punct_map = dict.fromkeys(map(ord, string.punctuation))
s.translate(remove_punct_map)

The dict.fromkeys() class method makes it trivial to create the mapping, setting all values to None based on the sequence of keys.
To remove all punctuation, not just ASCII punctuation, your table needs to be a little bigger; see J.F. Sebastian's answer (Python 3 version):
import unicodedata
import sys

remove_punct_map = dict.fromkeys(i for i in range(sys.maxunicode)
                                 if unicodedata.category(chr(i)).startswith('P'))


This question is over 6 years old, but I'd figured I chime in with a function I wrote. It's not very efficient, but it is simple and you can add or remove any punctuation that you desire:
def stripPunc(wordList):
    """Strips punctuation from list of words"""
    puncList = [".",";",":","!","?","/","\\",",","#","@","$","&",")","(","\""]
    for punc in puncList:
        for word in wordList:
            wordList=[word.replace(punc,'') for word in wordList]
    return wordList


One liner might be helpful in not very strict cases:
''.join([c for c in s if c.isalnum() or c.isspace()])


Here's a one liner for python 3.5:
import string
"l*ots! o(f. p@u)n[c}t]u[a'ti\"on#$^?/".translate(str.maketrans({a:None for a in string.punctuation}))


For the convenience of usage, I sum up the note of striping punctuation from a string in both Python2 and Python3. Please refer to other answers for the detailed description.

Python2
import string 

s = "string. With. Punctuation?"
table = string.maketrans("","") 
new_s = s.translate(table, string.punctuation)      # Output: string without punctuation


Python3
import string 

s = "string. With. Punctuation?"
table = str.maketrans({key: None for key in string.punctuation})
new_s = s.translate(table)                          # Output: string without punctuation


I haven't seen this answer yet. Just use a regex removes all characters besides word characters (\w) and number characters (\d), followed by a whitespace character (\s):
import re
s = "string. With. Punctuation?" # Sample string 
out = re.sub(ur'[^\w\d\s]+', '', s)


>>> s = "string. With. Punctuation?"
>>> s = re.sub(r'[^\w\s]','',s)
>>> re.split(r'\s*', s)


['string', 'With', 'Punctuation']


string.punctuation misses loads of punctation marks that are commonly used in the real world. How about a solution that works for non-ascii punctuationï¼
import regex
s = u"string. With. Someã»Really WeirdãNonï¼ASCIIã ãï¼Punctuationï¼ã?"
remove = regex.compile(ur'[\p{C}|\p{M}|\p{P}|\p{S}|\p{Z}]+', regex.UNICODE)
remove.sub(u" ", s).strip()

Personally, I beleive this is the best way to remove punctuation from a string in python because:

It removes all unicode punctuation 
It's easily modifiable, e.g. you can remove the \{S} if you want to remove punctuation but keep symbols like $. 
You can get really specific about what you want to keep and what you want to remove, for example \{Pd} will only remove dashes.
This regex also normalizes whitespace.  It maps tabs, carriage returns, and other oddities to nice, single spaces.

This uses unicode character properties, which you can read more about on wikipedia.
