Exporting dataset to excel error: Exception from HRESULT: 0x800A03EC
c# excel
I am having trouble in exporting to excel and it crashes out at the .set_Value function.
It seems to work if I change object[,] to string[,] but by doing this I lose the formatting.
Anyone Help?


Are you passing 'null' for missing parameters rather than System.Reflection.Missing.Value ?

I am passing Missing.Value but I have discovered what was the cause of this particular failure. The object[,] had a = sign as first character in some cells which caused Excel to fail so I checked for column type string and checked value if substring(0,1) == "=" then add a ' in front of = sign.
