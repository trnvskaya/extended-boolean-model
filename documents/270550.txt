Is there step-by-step tutorial on setting up CruiseControl.NET?
build-process build-automation cruisecontrol.net
What to do automatic nightly build of .NET web application and upload to the test server.  
Or, if this tool is overkill, please suggest something else.


CruiseControl.NET From Scratch
Its a great tool, we use it here todo hourly builds and manage multiple projects.

I used the instructions and example on the CruiseControl.Net website
Setting up from scratch Part 01.

I have found this great tutorial: How to Hook Up a VS.NET 2005 Solution With CruiseControl.NET in a Few Minutes.
It's short but uses a real .Net project to illustrate the set up.
After that refine your configuration by reading each relevant section of CruiseControl.NET : Configuring the Server
And for a really nice and recent tutorial check Integrating MSBuild with CruiseControl.NET. Very good one!

The other answers are all great, but have you also looked at CI Factory? From the CI Factory site:

CI Factory is a Continuous Integration
  system, not just a CI server.  With
  minimal configuration it creates a CI
  system for you including much of your
  development environment.  It will
  create a development tree, write your
  build scripts, setup a super powered
  version of CruiseControl.Net, import
  it all into source control, and more. 
  It does all the work that everyone has
  to do when creating a CI system.  It
  even has automated branch creation
  baked in, so the next time you need to
  create a branch for a release, CI
  Factory will handle that for you.
