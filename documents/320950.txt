The ';' character, hexadecimal value 0x3B, cannot be included in a name
c# asp.net
I have seen the error "The ';' character, hexadecimal value 0x3B, cannot be included in a name." in my log files for an ASP.NET Web App. The url that's logged looks something like this:
mypage.aspx?paramone=one+two&amp;paramtwo=zero+1

So my first question is what type of system/browser is encoding the original query string? (This happens rarely)
I've tried to address this problem with the following snippet of code in the Page_Load() event:
string rawUrl = Request.RawUrl;
if (rawUrl.Contains(amp))
{
    rawUrl = rawUrl.Replace("&amp;", "&");
    Server.Transfer(rawUrl, false);
    return;
}

However when it transfers back to this page the &amp; is back in the query string. So I'm guessing that the .Transfer() function encodes the first param.
Suggestions about solving this problem?



Your web server should be able to log the "user agent" field from the HTTP Request, which should enable you to identify the culprit.
Don't fix it - there's a very well defined set of legal syntaxes for URI parameters, and this ain't one of them.


When you try to export a Microsoft  catalog to XML, the resulting file cannot be imported, and you receive the following error message
"The XML file path/filename contains an error at line. " "A Name contained an invalid character."
If you validate the XML catalog by using Microsoft Visual Studio .NET  you receive the following error message:
"The '(' character, hexadecimal value 0x28, cannot begin a name. Line #, Position #"
This problem occurs because the Commerce Server export was not encoding the following special characters:
The range 0x0021 â 0x002F includes ! â # $ % & â ( ) * + , - . /
The range 0x03A â 0x0040 includes : ; < = > ? @
The range 0x007B â 0x007E includes { | } ~
The range 0x005B â 0x005E [ \ ] ^**
