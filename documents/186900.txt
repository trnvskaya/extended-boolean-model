Tool for web server redirect management?
webserver
I'm considering rolling my own, but just in case there's a good piece of software already available, I'm asking here: Is there something that will provide an interface to webserver redirect configuration, and allow redirects to be managed by a fairly non-technical userbase. The following requirements must be fulfilled:

Open-source
Apache
Support for internal / external redirects
Support for both web-server config and htaccess or meta-refresh files (for users who cannot restart the server)
Date range for validity



You could use either a RewriteMap script/program, or a static map (whichever is easiest for you/your users).
Check http://rewrite.drbacchus.com/rewritewiki/RewriteMap out for a basic example of the scripting capabilities. The performance hit is not as huge as you'd think because the process is launched one time only and stays alive until Apache is brought down. So be careful with resource management.
