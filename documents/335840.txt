What is the relative difference between in-proc, interprocess, and inter machine calls?
performance networking distributed latency
Ignoring payload size, what is relative difference in latency between an in-proc call (say in C++ or Java), a socket call to a process on the same machine, and a socket call to a process on another machine? This can be expressed as a minimum latency in ns/ms or in terms of relative orders of magnitude. 
I'm looking for something similar to this:

... but extended to in-proc vs. network calls (assume fast intranet).


does pinging your local machine and pinging a remote machine give you any sense of relationship?  A method call would of course be the other measurement.  

That is a good idea... not precise, but it gives the rough ratios:
method call -- ~100s ns
synchronized method call -- ~1000s ns
reflective method call -- low ~10,000s ns
machine loopback -- ~30,000-150,000 ns
local sub-network -- 1-2 ms
internet -- 30-100 ms
