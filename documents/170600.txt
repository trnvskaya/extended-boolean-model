UNIX socket implementation for Java?
java unix jdbc unix-domain-sockets
I realize that since UNIX sockets are platform-specific, there has to be some non-Java code involved.  Specifically, we're interested in using JDBC to connect to a MySQL instance which only has UNIX domain sockets enabled.  
It doesn't look like this is supported, but from what I've read it should be at least possible to write a SocketFactory for JDBC based on UNIX sockets if we can find a decent implementation of UNIX sockets for Java.  
Has anyone tried this?  Does anyone know of such an implementation?


Check out the JNA library. It's a halfway house between pure Java and JNI native code

Checkout the JUDS library. It is a Java Unix Domain Socket library...

Some searching on the internet has uncovered the following useful-looking library:

Writing a socket factory should be easy enough.  Once you've done so, you can pass it to your driver THUSLY.

You could use junixsocket:
http://code.google.com/p/junixsocket/
It already provides code for connecting to MySQL from Java (Connector/J) via Unix sockets.
One big advantage compared to other implementations is that junixsocket uses the standard Java Socket API.

The JNR project (which is a loose basis for project panama) has a unix socket implementation.
