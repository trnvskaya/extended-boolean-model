WPF: Can I restyle a checkbox template, so that the checkindicator is a red cross instead
wpf templates checkbox
I canÂ´t find a way to restyle the IsChecked indicator of a checkbox. As I can see from the checkbox template thereÂ´s no possibilities to restyle the indicator, just the "box" of the checkbox. Does anyone knows if itÂ´s possibly to restyle the IsChecked indicator?

People describe various ways of extracting or viewing the standard WPF control templates.

You will have to replace the entire CheckBox control template.
Start with the ChekcBox ControlTemplate MSDN example at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms752319.aspx
In the example you'll see this element:
<Path 
Width="7" Height="7" 
x:Name="CheckMark"
SnapsToDevicePixels="False" 
Stroke="{StaticResource GlyphBrush}"
StrokeThickness="2"
Data="M 0 0 L 7 7 M 0 7 L 7 0" />

This is the indicator, in this sample the indicator is already an X, so change Stroke to Red and You're done.
To change the shape of the indicator change the Path's Data property.
