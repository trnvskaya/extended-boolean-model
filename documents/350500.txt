How to convert a string to a Guid
c#
I did not find the TryParse method for the Guid.  Iâm wondering how others handle converting a guid in string format into a guid type.
Guid Id;
try
{
    Id = new Guid(Request.QueryString["id"]);
}
catch
{
    Id = Guid.Empty;
}



new Guid(string)

You could also look at using a TypeConverter.

Unfortunately, there isn't a TryParse() equivalent.  If you create a new instance of a System.Guid and pass the string value in, you can catch the three possible exceptions it would throw if it is invalid.
Those are:

ArgumentNullException
FormatException
OverflowException

I have seen some implementations where you can do a regex on the string prior to creating the instance, if you are just trying to validate it and not create it.

This will get you pretty close, and I use it in production and have never had a collision.  However, if you look at the constructor for a guid in reflector, you will see all of the checks it makes.
 public static bool GuidTryParse(string s, out Guid result)
    {
        if (!String.IsNullOrEmpty(s) && guidRegEx.IsMatch(s))
        {
            result = new Guid(s);
            return true;
        }

        result = default(Guid);
        return false;
    }

    static Regex guidRegEx = new Regex("^[A-Fa-f0-9]{32}$|" +
                          "^({|\\()?[A-Fa-f0-9]{8}-([A-Fa-f0-9]{4}-){3}[A-Fa-f0-9]{12}(}|\\))?$|" +
                          "^({)?[0xA-Fa-f0-9]{3,10}(, {0,1}[0xA-Fa-f0-9]{3,6}){2}, {0,1}({)([0xA-Fa-f0-9]{3,4}, {0,1}){7}[0xA-Fa-f0-9]{3,4}(}})$", RegexOptions.Compiled);


If all you want is some very basic error checking, you could just check the length of the string.
              string guidStr = "";
              if( guidStr.Length == Guid.Empty.ToString().Length )
                 Guid g = new Guid( guidStr );


Guid.TryParse()

or 
Guid.TryParseExact()

in .NET 4.0 (or 3.5?)

use code like this:
new Guid("9D2B0228-4D0D-4C23-8B49-01A698857709")

instade of "9D2B0228-4D0D-4C23-8B49-01A698857709" you can set your string value
