Opening an application inside a form - C# or VB.NET
c# vb.net winforms
I am writing an application and I would like to be able to display another application inside it.  (Think like a windows form with a small box, or a tab that is displaying a totally seperate application.)
Is that something that can be done? If so, can anyone give some direction on how to go about doing it? 
I am looking for something in the C# or VB.NET world.
THANKS! 


You need a hWnd (handle) of window from another application.
Then you need a hWnd of container control in you application (System.Windows.Forms.Control.Handle property).
Then you need use a Win32API function SetParent, and that all you need.
On the SetParent page is little sample, which should do what you need.
