How can I code desktop monitoring software?
c# monitoring desktop spying
I have to develop a tool for monitoring helpdesk agents. I can figure out how to capture keyboard events and mouse events; however I need to capture the control that emitted/consumed the event too. Is it possible to find that out?


You need windows hooks to pick up the events. These are really the province of native code. Try asking again with Win32 tag replacing the C# tag.

I used the code from Stephen Toub's blog to add a shortcut to my application in the system tray. The comments were quite useful as well.
