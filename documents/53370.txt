Where are people getting that rotaty loading image?
ajax image animation
I keep running across this loading image

which seems to have entered into existence in the last 18 months.  All of a sudden it is in every application and is on every web site.  Not wanting to be left out is there somewhere I can get this logo, perhaps with a transparent background?  Also where did it come from?  


You can get many different AJAX loading animations in any colour you want here: ajaxload.info

I believe the animation came from the Mac OS X loading screen. Here's a similar one with a transparent background:


I think it's just a general extension to the normal clock-face style loading icon.  The Firefox throbber is the first example of that style that I remember coming across; the only real difference between that and the current trend of straight lines is that the constituent symbols have been stretched to give a crisper look, moving back to more of a many-handed clock emblem.
