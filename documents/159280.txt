Do OCUnit and OCMock work on the iPhone SDK?
iphone objective-c cocoa unit-testing mocking
I simply could not make it work, and I am wondering if I am wasting my time, or if I am simply stupid!
Sorry I don't have the exact error I have right now. But I just want to know if it work or not!


I don't know whether OCUnit works with iPhone, but there is an iPhoneUnitTesting framework available from Google Code.

I created some OCUnit tests for an iPhone app, but in order to run the tests I had to compile for Mac OS X, not iPhone OS, and switching back and forth was a pain.
The Google framework is cleaner, they can run the tests in the simulator or on the device.

I got hung up on the same thing. I finally found the answer on Mitch's World then reposted the solution on my site. The quick fix is to add the OCMock.framework folder to /Library/frameworks and reference it from there. For whatever reason XCode doesn't want to add folders external to its natural framework seach to the path. Until I find out more this is the best we can do.

Not so sure about OCMock, but OCUnit support is now included in iPhone 2.2 SDK.
You can download an example application from Stanford iPhone Application Programming CS193P Lecture 19.

Colin Barrett has a blog post about OCMock and the iPhone.

Sen:te (the creator of the framework) explains how to use OCUnit with an iPhone project: http://www.sente.ch/s/?p=535&lang=en.

Take a look here. You'll find a Xcode template you can use that has OCUnit and OCMock all ready setup for you. 

At the time of writing OCUnit "just works" on the iPhone. Apple are shipping templates that works out of the box.
