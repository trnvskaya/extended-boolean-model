How do I detect "Easter Egg" mode in my Palm OS application?

Since the early days, Palm OS has had a special "easter egg" mode that's enabled by making the right gesture in one of the Preference panels.  On current Palm Treo and Centro devices, this is turned on by doing a clockwise swirl above the "Tips" button in the Power panel.
Some applications, like the Blazer web browser, enable special features when easter eggs are active.  How can I detect this in my own program?


The standard system preference for this is prefAllowEasterEggs (see Preference.h). This setting can be accessed using the PrefGetPreference API:
UInt32 enableEasterEggs = PrefGetPreference(prefAllowEasterEggs);

The value will be non-zero when the user has requested that Easter eggs be available.
