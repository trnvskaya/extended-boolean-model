What tools to use for developing flash/flex based touch screen user interface for embedded system
flash embedded
We are looking at developing a device with a touch screen and an embedded PC like computer for the user interface.
What are the benefits and disadvantages of using flash/flex for this user interface development?
One of our goals is to seperate the design (= look and feel) and the functionality of the application to ease the development.


Regarding Flash
Pros:

Readily available
Powerful editing tools
Lots of people know how to use it

Cons:

(Very) bad performance in contrast to what it does
Open source implementations still lagging
Use of Adobe's flash component is regulated by their EULA
Does not offer a clear cut API for embedding
