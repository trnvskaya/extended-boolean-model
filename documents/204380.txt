Directory of APIs/WebServices - where do I find one?
web-services api list directory service
Where do I find a directory where a lot of APIs or Webservices are collected? I'd like to generate a Web Site getting its content from different services, but I assume that spidering together the content is not legal (e.g. getting the latest financial data from finance.yahoo.com).
So I would like to have a list of APIs and WebServices (not only financially related) where I can search for such services. It would also help to generate 'new' ideas, while reading through the list => I'm sure there are a lot of services I do not even think of.


From this question:

http://www.programmableweb.com/apis
http://www.webservicelist.com/


I'd suggest a visit to ProgrammableWeb, especially its API Directory.
