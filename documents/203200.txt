Undo changes to SQL Server 2005 database
sql sql-server sql-server-2005 recovery
I've ran some "ALTER" scripts on the database [SQL Server Server 2005], and overwrote some sprocs. Is there any way to undo changes and get my old sprocs back?
Is there a way to get the scripts that were executed out of the .LDf file? That way i can re-run my initial "create" script for my sprocs.
I don't have a backup file with old sprocs.
p.s. i backed the DB up as per @Gulzar's deleted answer, and looks like I'm "hosed".
@Pittsburgh DBA: thanx for the solution, but it doesn't seem to work after the backup.
MORAL: Wait for 10 minutes before trying the suggested answers out

Update from Gulzar: What I meant was a file backup before trying anything (to be safe). Not a SQL Server backup.


FIRST: DO NOT TAKE ANY BACKUPS JUST YET.
There are several tools on the market to do this sort of thing. 
You might try this one:
ApexSQL Log

And after that, look into using ApexSQLScript to script out your databases on a regular basis (and store in version control).

In case anybody else has the same problem - Were you doing transaction log backups every X minutes?  If so, you can use Quest LiteSpeed's log reader or Quest Toad for SQL Server's log reader to read the log file backups.  It gives undo/redo scripts too for any transaction in the log backups or the ldf.

yo do can!!
go to sql server managment studio,connect to your db, left click on your db and go to "tasks".
select restore -> database.
then click the "timeline" button and select 'especific date' and select the day before your mistake.
All programs that have access to your db mus be closed.
It worked for me, i had this very same probelm.
