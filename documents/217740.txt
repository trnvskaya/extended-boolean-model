silverlight blogs?
silverlight
With the asp.net MVC framework the blogs of the team members (Rob Conery, Phil Haack etc) really helped me on my way and made me feel comfortable the development was going in the right direction.
Is there something similar for Silverlight?
-Edit:
I would like to mention that I would like to find members of the dev team themselves.
Currently the support for Silverlight across OS and browser is just too poor to make me care and invest time in it.
But I would like to keep a spying eye out so I can start caring when the framework fulfils it's potentials.

at least this is some excerpt from my blog reader 

Scott Guthrie the product manager of .NET Framework writes form time to time about Silverlight in his blog. He reports about new releases and the feature they come with it and sometimes he posts some really nice tutorials to give examples how to use these features. 
But of course the blog's focus lies more on the whole .NET Framework as only on Silverlight. 


thanks for the feedback already. Are
  any of those actually part of the
  Silverlight dev team?
