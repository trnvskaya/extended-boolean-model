.net webservice publishing process question
asp.net web-services publish
I have a webservice that exists in an asp.net website.  When I publish the site to a test server I have to go into the bin folder and into the .svc file for the service and manually change the URL to correctly reflect the test server URL.  Is there a better way to handle something like this?


You could always run a build tool to automatically do this for you.
