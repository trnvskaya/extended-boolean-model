Where can I find a list of SocketErrorCode and NativeErrorCode thrown by SocketException?
c# .net winapi exception sockets
A SocketException has a SocketErrorCode and NativeErrorCode.
I would like to find a list where these codes (or the common onces)
are listed so I can respond in proper fasion.
Does anybody know where to find such a list?


MSDN? SocketError; or from the native ErrorCode, the MSDN page states: "For more information about socket error codes, see the Windows Sockets version 2 API error code documentation in MSDN.".
A few searches shows this here.
