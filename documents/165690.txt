Can J# code run on JVM
j#
If I create a J# Application is there any way I can execute it on JVM as well


No, J# programs are designed to run on the .NET platform. See the J# FAQ.

Yes - sort of. If the Java you write will compile using javac then you can have one source base and compile for both J# and Java. We do that for our reporting engine. If you do this on .net 40, you need Calling J# code from .NET 4.0.
But you cannot run the J# binary on a JVM.
