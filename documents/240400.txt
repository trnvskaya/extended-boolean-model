MYSQL: Create Table If Not Exists
sql mysql
If I do a Create Table If Not Exists, and a table with the same name exists with fewer rows (or columns), what would happen?


Nothing.  If the "IF Not Exists" clause fails, the rest of the create is skipped.

The table will not be created if a table with the same name already exists regardless of table layout.
