Cannot import SQLite with Python 2.6
python sqlite
I'm running Python 2.6 on Unix and when I run the interactive prompt (SQLite is supposed to be preinstalled) I get:
[root@idev htdocs]# python
Python 2.6 (r26:66714, Oct 23 2008, 16:25:34)
[GCC 3.2.2 20030222 (Red Hat Linux 3.2.2-5)] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import sqlite
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ImportError: No module named sqlite
>>>

How do I resolve this?


import sqlite3

sqlite3 - DB-API 2.0 interface for SQLite databases.
You are missing the .so (shared object) - probably an installation step. In my Linux python installation, _sqlite3 is at: 
${somewhere}/lib/python2.6/lib-dynload/_sqlite3.so


The error: 
ImportError: No module named _sqlite3

means that SQLite 3 does not find the associated shared library. On Mac OS X it's _sqlite3.so and it should be the same on other Unix systems. 
To resolve the error you have to locate the _sqlite3.so library on your computer and then check your PYTHONPATH for this directory location. 
To print the Python search path enter the following in the Python shell:
import sys
print sys.path

If the directory containing your library is missing you can try adding it interactively with 
sys.path.append('/your/dir/here')

and try 
import sqlite3

again. If this works you have to add this directory permanently to your PYTHONPATH environment variable. 
PS: If the library is missing you should (re-)install the module.

Try this:
from pysqlite2 import dbapi2 as sqlite


On my system _sqlite3.so located at:
'/usr/lib/python2.6/lib-dynload/_sqlite3.so'

Check that the directory is in your sys.path:
>>> import sys; print(filter(lambda p: 'lib-dynload' in p, sys.path))
['/usr/lib/python2.6/lib-dynload']


Python 2.6 detects where the sqlite3 development headers are installed, and will silently skip building _sqlite3 if it is not available. If you are building from source, install sqlite3 including development headers. In my case, sudo yum install sqlite-devel sorted this out on a CentOS 4.7. Then, rebuild Python from source code.

Does that fix your problem?
Python 2.5.4 (r254:67916, May 31 2009, 16:56:01)
[GCC 4.3.3] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

The 2.5.5. Mac port of Python 2.5 now has this hint:
"py25-sqlite3 @2.5.4 (python, databases)
    This is a stub. sqlite3 is now built with python25"

And so an upgrade of the python25 port to python25 @2.5.5_0 made the import work again.
Since sqlite3 is among the dependencies of python25,
it is built anew when upgrading python25.
Thus,
$ sudo port upgrade python25

does the trick on Mac OS X, ports collection.

I face the same problem.
Steps to solve.

Download latest sqlite3 from sqlite website.   sqlite-autoconf*
Install that in 3 simple steps

./configure
make
make install

Rebuild the python
make 
make install
