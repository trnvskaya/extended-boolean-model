source for eclipse plugin.xml page
eclipse rcp
I would like to know where can I find the code which eclipse uses to display the forms in the plugin.xml file. In particular I am looking for the form layout used in the extension tab in the plugin.xml


Unfortunately, Eclipse's plugin search doesn't work for referenced plugins.  To do these searches I created a workspace that contains all the plugins from my eclipse install as source folders.  I just open the workspace and perform my plugin search there.  Just open the search dialog and choose plugin.

You can import the eclipse plugins into your workspace by using import -> Plugins and Fragments from the package explorer.  Then use the following options:

Select from all plug-ins and fragments found at the specified location
import from the target platform with source folders (last option)

Import the org.eclipse.pde.ui plugin
The code you seek is in org.eclipse.pde.internal.ui.editor.plugin
More specifically, the ExtensionPointsPage class
