What are the different database options on Windows Mobile available?
I have used CEDB and EDB for linear dataset needs.
I have heard of SQL server 2005 Mobile edition. But what are the advantages over others (if there is any)


We use Sybase Ultralite. Before that we were using Codebase to connect to foxpro tables. I'm not a mobile developer but I understand we chose it over SQL Server for performance and memory usage. Also we found they had pretty good support when we found any issues.

I think it's called SQL Server Compact now.  The advantages are that it's syntax-compatible with full sql server in that any query you write for it is guaranteed to work on an equivalent SQL Server Express/Standard/Enterprise DB.  The reverse isn't necessarily true, though.

Do you need SQL support?  If not, look at a lightweight embeddable DBM-like solution.  I've used Tokyo Cabinet for a number of embedded solutions where SQL wasn't necessary and have greatly enjoyed the speed and flexibility it provides.  YMMV.

Also take a look at SQLite for Windows CE.  There are also .NET bindings available to use it from the Compact Framework.

I would avoid using CEDB any more as I beleave that WM7 is dropping support for it. 

I've found both sqllite and codebase to be easy to implement and install. Easier (and more stable) than the Microsoft options, which seem to be in serious flux.
