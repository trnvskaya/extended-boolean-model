Perform token replacements using VS post-build event command?
.net visual-studio-2008 visual-studio-2005
I would like to "post-process" my app.config file and perform some token replacements after the project builds.
Is there an easy way to do this using a VS post-build event command?
(Yeah I know I could probably use NAnt or something, looking for something simple.)


Take a look at XmlPreProcess. We use it for producing different config files for our testing and live deployment packages. 
We execute it from a nant script as part of a continuous build but, since it's a console app, I see no reason why you coudn't add a call in your project's post-build event instead
