What is the most useful type of java.awt.image.BufferedImage for off-screen rendering?
java swing graphics awt
I am creating a buffered image that is going to be a snapshot of a JComponent (via paint()) and rendered inside an ImageIcon.  There are a large amount of types in the BufferedImage(int width, int height, int imageType) constructor, but which one should I use?  
I am sure that any of them would work, but which ones are better than the others?  How should I pick one? And Why?


See GraphicsConfiguration.createCompatibleImage(int, int) for a helper to create a BufferedImage of a "good" type among the many available types.
How to get your hands on a GraphicsConfiguration instance to make this call?  It depends on where your code is executing.  See the many methods for getting your hands on a GraphicsConfiguration via methods like getGraphicsConfiguration() or getDeviceConfiguration().
