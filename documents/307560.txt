Tips on making good documentation for developers
language-agnostic documentation
I'm preparing documentation for an open source project. My target audience are developers.
Right now, I'm working on the API, porting and code design sections.
Anyone has any tips on making documentation for developers?


Document the code.
Use javadoc or doxygen to generate the API documentation. Add a build step to do this automatically!
If you find sections lacking detail, add more comments to the code, and then regenerate the documentation.
Provide working examples, and take the time to comment those as well!

Include simple examples that illustrates the intent of the API call in question. Very often, being able to look at code explains things much better then prose can (because of differences in culture, language ability etc).

Make sure you have complete working examples on how to use the program, or call the library.
Make sure the unit tests are public in your project.
