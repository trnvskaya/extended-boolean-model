Singular/plural searches and stemming
search stemming
I'm discovering a simple solution for singular-plural keywords searches. I heard about stemming but I don't want to use all its features, only plural/singular transformation. The language is Dutch. Have looked at http://www.snowball.tartarus.org before. Does anyone know the simple solution for singular|plural relevant searches?
Thanks in advance.


Use a dictionary, a list of stopwords (those you don't want to singularize) plus the rules for the language. If you don't know Dutch then I cannot help you, but show you how it'd be done in Spanish, for instance:

Plurals end with s, if it doesn't then it's done

If it ends with s, 

check if it's a verb or conjugation ending with s if it is one, then it's done (verbs could be added to the stopwords list)
if it's not a verb, remove s 
if the word exists in the dictionary, done
if it doesn't remove the previous letter, and check it in the dictionary.
if it's still not there it's an exception you'll need to check manually to code in the exceptions (I cannot right now think of any, but they always exist :)



Of course this will not translate directly to Dutch.
In general stemmers are already done and provide most of what you need, why don't you want them?

Stemmers caused much user annoyance, so if I use one of them, all functionality except singular/plural should be disabled. So the requirement is to use only plural/singular transformations.

The answer is correct, but it's worth mentioning that the Dutch language has a large number of irregular verbs.  This makes stemming more of a table lookup problem than a set of single rules.
You'll need access to a corpora, you can find one for the Dutch language here: http://corpus1.mpi.nl/ds/imdi_browser/
