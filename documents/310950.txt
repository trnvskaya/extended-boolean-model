Remote Name could not be resolved
asp.net service
While accessing a webservice which is availbale at http://recpushdata.cyndigo.com/jobs.asmx, I am getting this Exception. "Remote name could not be resolved"
Any Suggesytion..what to do..


Try using the URL:
http://216.10.246.91/jobs.asmx
If this works, whereever you are calling the web service from has a problem with DNS. If that does not work report back.

The server error you got in the previous comment is good - it means your original problem, being unable to resolve the remote host, is solved.  
As to your HTTP 500 error, check the event log for that time on the remote host.  If you don't have access to it, contact its administrator.
