Firebug - how can I run multiline scripts or create a new JavaScript file?
javascript firefox firebug
Is there a way in Firebug to start a new script file to apply to page?  Basically I want to do work like I'd normally do on the Firebug console but be able to to paste in multi-line functions, etc.  It doesn't seem like the console is amenable to that.


Down in the lower-right corner of the FireBug UI you should see a red square icon with an up arrow. Use that and stretch it to a size you like.





maybe not within firebug, but you could try some techniques similar to the jQuery bookmarklet.

What about this idea:
Assuming your page can already have script tags that reference jQuery and a 'Script Include' jQuery plugin, then in the Console you could arbitrarily do:
$.include('http://example.com/scripts/some_script.js');
