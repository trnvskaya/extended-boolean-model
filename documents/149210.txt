AVI Animations for GUI
delphi user-interface animation vcl avi
I need to get some AVI animations for use with the Borland VCL TAnimate component, to display during operations such as 'online update', 'burning cd' and a few others.
I have only come across the glyFX Animation Pack so far.
Can anybody recomend other places to get nice avi animations?


You could consider using GIF animations instead of AVIs. There are a lots of them on the Web. There are also some free Delphi components working with animated GIFs, look TGIFImage for Delphi for example.
