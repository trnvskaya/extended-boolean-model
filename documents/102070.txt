Is there a tutotial or help file, suitable for a beginner c# programmer to use.


Andy Beaulieu has beein doing a lot of work to make Farseer easier to use in Silverlight, you can read about it here:

The primary documentation for the Farseer Physics engine is on the homepage.

You can also check out the source code, they have a demos folder in there, though it's only got one example, but it can show you how to implement the engine

For a last resort, check out their forums, and ask some questions. They seem nice enough that they should be able to help you out with any questions.

I realize this is an old question, but for future searchers I will post a few links:
