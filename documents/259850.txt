Javascript - multiple client-side validations on same event
javascript html validation
I am performing two validations on the client side on the samve event.
I have defined my validations as shown below
btnSearch.Attributes["OnClick"] = "javascript:return prepareSave(); return prepareSearch();"

Pseudo code for 
prepareSave():
{
  if (bPendingchanges)
    {
     return confirm('Need to save pending changes first, click OK and loose changes or cancel to save them first')
    }
  else
   {return true}
}

Pseudo code for 
prepareSearch():
{
  if (bNoSearchText)
    {
      alert('Please specify search criteria before proceeding')
      return false;
   }
  else
   {return true;}
}

When bPendingchanges=false, I never get the second validation running.
Anyone who can quickly spot what I have overlooked here? Please?


Your second return statement will never be reached. Execution stops after javascript:return prepareSave().
Looks like you want to return true if both functions return true - therefore, do:
btnSearch.Attributes["OnClick"] = javascript: return prepareSave() && prepareSearch();


That's because the return prevents the second validation from running. Try this
btnSearch.Attributes["OnClick"] = "javascript:return prepareSave() && prepareSearch();"


"javascript:return prepareSave(); return prepareSearch();"
1) You shouldn't have the "javascript:"
2) return prepareSearch(); will never be executed, because "return prepareSave(); exits your event handler
Try "return (prepareSave() && prepareSearch());"

return, as the name implies, returns control back to whatever called the code in question. Therefore, anything that's after a return statement
return prepareSave(); return prepareSearch();
//                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ e.g. this part

never executes. Try return (prepareSave() && prepareSearch());
