What should be in a 'technical work plan'?
project-management risk-management
I'm applying for grant to fund part of the development of a web app, one question I'm stuck on says to describe the: 
Tasks and full technical details and risks relating to your project, including detailed technical work plan
Any guidance on what specific topics should be covered would be very gratefully received
There is a separate question regarding the proposed methodology - but I have this covered
Background info. - It's a rails projects and we've been using BDD (user stories) and XP


Well that's a pretty open-ended question, but as regards the work plan, you should probably focus on the specific tasks you're actually going to need to complete to get to the end goal of having a working system. I'm thinking of things like:

Install the environment.
Define the database schema and what drivers are needed to interact with it.
Develop the XYZ front-end.
Develop the ABC back-end.

Depending on what's expected, I would say there's a good chance you'll need to attach man-day sizings to these.
These are just examples - not only will you need to be more complete, you'll also want to put a lot more detail in there. Obviously I can't do that, not knowing the details of your project.
