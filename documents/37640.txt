Apex SQL Doc


If you are on SQL Server 2000/2005 you can use DBdoc
(SQL 2005 requires a patch that is listed in the comments below the article)
If you have money to spend, you can also use RedGate SQL doc (1.3 is the latest version). It offers (from the homepage):

Fast, simple database documentation
Document one or multiple databases,
down to object level
Write, edit, and export documentation in easy-to-read HTML files or .chm files for team distribution
Includes all cross-database dependencies


We use a wiki so that all developers can/should update it and it is a team effort. A tool that is makes it hard to share, and requires a central "document" will be hard to maintain.
What really do you need? As long as you have a table with the DB schema, document the possible values of each column and their meaning (i.e 1="on hold", 2="Canceled") and then put a image of the main DB tables connected with the foreign keys (export from SQL Server 2005) you are good to go. 

We use Redgate SQL Doc and we're very happy with the results. We've also had reasonably good results from Document! X from Innovasys (but we mainly use this for documenting COM interfaces). 

@csmba - good point re giving all developers an ability to update the docs. It was actually one of the main reasons (if not the main) I implemented my SQL Server DB documentation tool (LiveDoco) as a Web Application.
I considered Wiki engines as well, but I think this approach requires too much manual labor, especially synchronizing Wiki pages with DB Schema changes, So it kinda defeats the purpose...
Another good DB documentation generator (and BTW cheaper) is ElsaSoft SqlSpec it even does diagrams and works with most(maybe all) major RDBMS.
