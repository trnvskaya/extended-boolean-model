Show file tree in visual studio 2005?
visual-studio
I have a large project that I want to start using visual studio 2005 to edit. I want to tell it "Here are all the files I want you to track, now get on with it" and have them displayed as a directory tree, for example:
Folder 1
 - File A
 - File B
 - File C
Folder 2
 - Folder 3
   - File X
   - File Y
 - File D
 - File E

Right now it's just showing all the header files in one big list, and all the source files in one big list, which I find unhelpful. I also don't want to spend ages creating a folder in the project for each folder on the disk.
Is there any way I can get VS to show me a source tree of everything in the solution, organised by where it is on the actual disk?
Thanks.


click on the 'show all files' icon in the solution explorer, then select the folders you want to include, right click and select 'include in project'.

To clairfy this: To import a source tree with all subfolders, represented in the VS Explorer View like it is on the filesystem, you have to create a new Solution via the menu entry
Datei >> Neu >> Projekt aus vorhandenem Code
which is the last entry in the New... menu in VS2005 Pro (german version) for example.
This opens a wizard where you will find the mentioned Show All Files and Select Folders options.
