How can i make a catch all route to handle '404 page not found' queries for ASP.NET MVC?
asp.net-mvc routes http-status-code-404
Is it possible to create a final route that catches all .. and bounces the user to a 404 view in ASP.NET MVC?
NOTE: I don't want to set this up in my IIS settings.


Found the answer myself.
Richard Dingwall has an excellent post going through various strategies. I particularly like the FilterAttribute solution. I'm not a fan of throwing exceptions around willy nilly, so i'll see if i can improve on that :)
For the global.asax, just add this code as your last route to register:
routes.MapRoute(
    "404-PageNotFound",
    "{*url}",
    new { controller = "StaticContent", action = "PageNotFound" }
    );


This might be a problem when you use
throw new HttpException(404);

When you want to catch that, I don't know any other way then editing your web config.

This question came first, but the easier answer came in a later question:
Custom ASP.NET MVC 404 Error Page

I got my error handling to work by creating an ErrorController that
  returns the views in this article. I also had to add the "Catch All"
  to the route in global.asax. 
I cannot see how it will get to any of these error pages if it is not
  in the Web.config..? My Web.config had to specify:
customErrors mode="On" defaultRedirect="~/Error/Unknown"

and then I also added:
error statusCode="404" redirect="~/Error/NotFound"

Hope this helps.

I love this way now because it is so simple:
 <customErrors mode="On" defaultRedirect="~/Error/" redirectMode="ResponseRedirect">
    <error statusCode="404" redirect="~/Error/PageNotFound/" />
 </customErrors>


An alternative to creating a catch-all route is to add an Application_EndRequest method to your MvcApplication per Marco's Better-Than-Unicorns MVC 404 Answer.

Add this lines under your project root web.config File.
 <system.webServer>
<httpErrors errorMode="Custom" existingResponse="Replace">
  <remove statusCode="404" />
  <error statusCode="404" responseMode="ExecuteURL" path="/Test/PageNotFound" />
  <remove statusCode="500" />
  <error statusCode="500" responseMode="ExecuteURL" path="/Test/PageNotFound" />
</httpErrors>
<modules>
  <remove name="FormsAuthentication" />
</modules>



If the route cannot be resolved, then MVC framework will through 404 error.. 
Best approach is to use Exception Filters ... Create a custom exceptionfilter and make like this.. 
public class RouteNotFoundAttribute : FilterAttribute, IExceptionFilter {
    public void OnException(ExceptionContext filterContext) {
        filterContext.Result  = new RedirectResult("~/Content/RouteNotFound.html");
   }
}


Inside RouterConfig.cs add the follwing piece of code:
  routes.MapRoute(
           name: "Error",
           url: "{id}",
           defaults: new
           {
               controller = "Error",
               action = "PageNotFound"

           });


Also you can handle NOT FOUND error in Global.asax.cs as below 
protected void Application_Error(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    Exception lastErrorInfo = Server.GetLastError();
    Exception errorInfo = null;

    bool isNotFuund = false;
    if (lastErrorInfo != null)
    {
        errorInfo = lastErrorInfo.GetBaseException();
        var error = errorInfo as HttpException;
        if (error != null)
            isNotFuund = error.GetHttpCode() == (int)HttpStatusCode.NotFound;
    }
    if (isNotFuund)
    {
        Server.ClearError();
        Response.Redirect("~/Error/NotFound");// Do what you need to render in view
    }
}
