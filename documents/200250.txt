How do I remove a cookie that I've set on someone's computer?
python apache http cookies
I've got a web system where users log in, and it stores a cookie of their session. When they log in as someone else or log out I want to remove that original cookie that I stored. What's the best way to do that?
I'm using Python and Apache, though I suppose the answer will remain the same for most languages.


I guess the best way is to set the expiration to a date of the cookie to some date in the past.

Set the cookie again, as if you hadn't set it the first time, but specify an expiration date that is in the past.

Return the header

Set-Cookie: token=opaque; Domain=.your.domain; Expires=Thu, 01-Jan-1970 00:00:10 GMT; Path=/ 

The Domain and Path must match the original attributes that the cookie was issued under.
