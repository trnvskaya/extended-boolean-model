Python/editline on OS X: Â£ sign seems to be bound to ed-prev-word
python osx unix terminal editline
On Mac OS X I canât enter a pound sterling sign (Â£) into the Python interactive shell.
* Mac OS X 10.5.5
* Python 2.5.1 (r251:54863, Jan 17 2008, 19:35:17)
* European keyboard (Â£ is shift-3)

When I type shift-3 in the Python interactive shell, I seem to invoke the previous word function, i.e. the cursor will move to the start of the last âwordâ (i.e. space-delimited item) typed on the line. When Iâm back in the bash shell, typing shift-3 just produces a Â£, as expected.
This version of Python apparently uses editline for its interactive shell, as opposed to readline. Iâm guessing that one of the default editline key bindings binds shift-3 (or whatever editline sees when I type shift-3) to the ed-prev-word command.
Iâve tried a few things in my ~/.editrc file to remove this binding, and they donât have any effect:

bind -r Â£
bind -r \243
bind -r \156

And another that causes a bus error:

bind Â£ \243

Any ideas?


This may be an editline issue; libedit may not accept UTF-8 characters:
