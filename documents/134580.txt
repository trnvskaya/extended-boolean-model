Applescriptable mySQL client - low cost or free?
mysql osx applescript
Can anyone recommend a MySQL front end client or OS X that is AppleScriptable?  Preferably low cost or free.


I would suggest just using the command-line mysql client and using the do shell script command in applescript to invoke it:
do shell script "mysql -e 'select * from customer'"
