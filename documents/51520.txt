How to get an absolute file path in Python
python path relative-path absolute-path
Given a path such as "mydir/myfile.txt", how do I find the absolute filepath relative to the current working directory in Python? E.g. on Windows, I might end up with:
"C:/example/cwd/mydir/myfile.txt"



>>> import os
>>> os.path.abspath("mydir/myfile.txt")


>>> import os
>>> os.path.abspath('mydir/myfile.txt')
'C:\\example\\cwd\\mydir\\myfile.txt'
>>>


Better still, install the path.py module, it wraps all the os.path functions and other related functions into methods on an object that can be used wherever strings are used:
>>> from path import path
>>> path('mydir/myfile.txt').abspath()
'C:\\example\\cwd\\mydir\\myfile.txt'
>>>


Today you can also use the unipath package which was based on path.py: http://sluggo.scrapping.cc/python/unipath/
>>> from unipath import Path
>>> absolute_path = Path('mydir/myfile.txt').absolute()
Path('C:\\example\\cwd\\mydir\\myfile.txt')
>>> str(absolute_path)
C:\\example\\cwd\\mydir\\myfile.txt
>>>

I would recommend using this package as it offers a clean interface to common os.path utilities.

You could use the new Python 3.4 library pathlib. (You can also get it for Python 2.6 or 2.7 using pip install pathlib.) The authors wrote: "The aim of this library is to provide a simple hierarchy of classes to handle filesystem paths and the common operations users do over them."
To get an absolute path in Windows:
>>> from pathlib import Path
>>> p = Path("pythonw.exe").resolve()
>>> p
WindowsPath('C:/Python27/pythonw.exe')
>>> str(p)
'C:\\Python27\\pythonw.exe'

Or on UNIX:
>>> from pathlib import Path
>>> p = Path("python3.4").resolve()
>>> p
PosixPath('/opt/python3/bin/python3.4')
>>> str(p)
'/opt/python3/bin/python3.4'

I prefer to use glob
here is how to list all file types in your current folder:
import glob
for x in glob.glob():
    print(x)

here is how to list all (for example) .txt files in your current folder:
import glob
for x in glob.glob('*.txt'):
    print(x)

here is how to list all file types in a chose directory:
import glob
for x in glob.glob('C:/example/hi/hello/'):
    print(x)

hope this helped you
