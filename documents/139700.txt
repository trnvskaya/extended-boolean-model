Does the latest version of the enterprise library (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc512464.aspx) come with the updater application block?


Looks like it doesn't:

It's now in the 'Archived Application Blocks' section of the MSDN docs.

No. Microsoft considers the Updater Application Block to be replaced by ClickOnce in .NET 2.0. The Enterprise Library for .NET 1.1 is no longer updated.
