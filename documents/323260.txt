How can I remove default banner of web server from response - Apache http1.1 coyote
http header
Please let me know how can I remove default banner of web server from response - Apache http1.1 coyote


If you're talking about the generated line at the bottom of apache generated pages, you have to update your httpd.conf with this command:
ServerSignature Off

See http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/core.html#serversignature
Be careful, theses informations are also sent through HTTP headers. You can alter them via this directive
About Coyote, AFAIK there is no key to hide these info.

In server.xml there will be a <Connector> element.  Add a server attribute to it.  For example:
<Connector executor="tomcatThreadPool"
    port="80" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
    server=" "
    ...
/>

Unfortunately, setting the server attribute to an empty string doesn't cause any change in behavior.  Setting server to a string with a single space results in a header like:
Server:  

While not optimal, it's progress.
