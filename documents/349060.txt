Report section style list numbering in CSS?
html css
Now I know about the "normal" CSS list styles (roman, latin, etc) and certainly in years past they were somewhat inflexible in not allowing things like:
(a)
or 
a)
only
a.
Now I believe that you can get an effect like the above with the :before and :after pseudo-elements.  Is that correct?  And whats the browser compatibility like if you can?
My main question however is that I want to have report style numbering:

Introduction
1.1 Objectives
1.2 Assumptions
1.3 Limitations
1.3.1 ...
New Section
...

and so on.
Can CSS do this and, if so, whats the browser compatibility like?


See Generated content, automatic numbering, and lists.

This example shows a way to number
  chapters and sections with "Chapter
  1", "1.1", "1.2", etc.

H1:before {
	content: "Chapter " counter(chapter) ". ";
	counter-increment: chapter;  /* Add 1 to chapter */
	counter-reset: section;      /* Set section to 0 */
}
H2:before {
	content: counter(chapter) "." counter(section) " ";
	counter-increment: section;
}

Edit: quirksmode.org has a better table of css supports on browsers. Almost all browsers, except pre IE8b2 IEs. So yes, totally useless.

A simple markup example would be:
<ol>
	<li>level one</li>
	<ol start="10"> 
		<li>level two</li>
		<li>level two</li>
		<ol start="110">
			<li>level three</li>
		</ol> 
		<li>level two
	</ol> 
	<li>level one</li>
</ol>

The result of this is:
   1.  level one
        10. level two
        11. level two
             110. level three
        12. level two 
   2. level one

Browser support is fairly wide: MSIE6 complies. This is HTML 4.0

Here's the W3C specification for CSS2's automatic numbering and incrementing, with an example of 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 type numbering.

I can't help you with the support question.

Here is my complete version of the pure css solution which goes all the way to level h6.
Tested with IE9 and Firefox 28.
body {
  counter-reset:level1Header;
}
h1 {
  counter-reset:level2Header;
}
h2 {
  counter-reset:level3Header;
}
h3 {
  counter-reset:level4Header;
}
h4 {
  counter-reset:level5Header;
}
h5 {
  counter-reset:level6Header;
}

h1:before {
  counter-increment:level1Header;
  content:counter(level1Header) ". ";
}

h2:before {
  counter-increment:level2Header;
  content:counter(level1Header) "." counter(level2Header) " ";
}

h3:before {
  counter-increment:level3Header;
  content:counter(level1Header) "." counter(level2Header) "." counter(level3Header) " ";
}

h4:before {
  counter-increment:level4Header;
  content:counter(level1Header) "." counter(level2Header) "." counter(level3Header) "." counter(level4Header) " ";
}

h5:before {
  counter-increment:level5Header;
  content:counter(level1Header) "." counter(level2Header) "." counter(level3Header) "." counter(level4Header) "." counter(level5Header) " ";
}

h6:before {
  counter-increment:level6Header;
  content:counter(level1Header) "." counter(level2Header) "." counter(level3Header) "." counter(level4Header) "." counter(level5Header) "." counter(level6Header) " ";
}
