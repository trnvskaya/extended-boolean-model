Krypton Form not showing up in Visual Studio Professional 2008
visual-studio krypton-toolkit
I have just installed the Krypton Toolkit 3.0.6 from component Factory.
I find that in the create new Project Dialog Box , Krypton Form does not show up as an option. I am sure it used to show up ( and I have actually used it in an earlier version of krypton toolkit).But after the new install it does not.
Has anyone else faced this situation and can help.
Thanks.


The "New Krypton Form" used to show up not inside the "new project" dialog, but inside the "new item" dialog. (e.g. right-click on project, Add New Item)
But I don't see it there either. Phil may have removed this from the installer.
In any case, just add a regular Form, then make it derive from KryptonForm rather than Form, and voila, you have yourself a KryptonForm.

Thanks Judah,
For the sake of completeness and accuracy , I am posting the actual code for inheriting from a krypton form.
public partial class Form1  : ComponentFactory.Krypton.Toolkit.KryptonForm
