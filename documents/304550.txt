Spin Control in Delphi
delphi controls
I want to use a "spin button control" (also known as an up-down control) in my Delphi Win 32 application (I'm using Delphi 2007). 
The aim is to have a control that looks like in Microsoft Office:

I found this on the Microsoft website: CSpinButtonCtrl Class
But I haven't so far found a control that uses this class - here's where I've been searching:

The SpinEdit control in Delphi looks well... not so good, and doesn't seem to use the official Microsoft control
The JVCL classes have their own implementation
A Google search did not return any results (except some home-brew up/down controls)
I couldn't find something in the Jedi API as well

Can somebody please point me to where I can find a Delphi implementation of the common spin control from Microsoft, or how I can do that myself?


Have a look at TUpDown. It wraps the Win32 control.

Raize Components Raize.com have a nice one

TMS Software do a wide range of components including spin edits (fancy an iPhone style one!) and I have found their support through the newsgroups to be excellent.
