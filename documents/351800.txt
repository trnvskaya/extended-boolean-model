How do you do inline delegates in vb.net like c#?
vb.net
Is it possible to create an inline delegate in vb.net like you can in c#?
For example, I would like to be able to do something inline like this:
myObjects.RemoveAll(delegate (MyObject m) { return m.X >= 10; });

only in VB and without having to do something like this
myObjects.RemoveAll(AddressOf GreaterOrEqaulToTen) 

Private Function GreaterOrEqaulToTen(ByVal m as MyObject)
    If m.x >= 10 Then 
         Return true
    Else
         Return False
    End If
End Function

-- edit --
I should have mentioned that I am still working in .net 2.0 so I won't be able to use lambdas.


Try:
myObjects.RemoveAll(Function(m) m.X >= 10)

This works in 3.5, not sure about the 2.0 syntax.

myObjects.RemoveAll(Function(m As MyObject) m.X >= 10)

See Lambda Expressions on MSDN
