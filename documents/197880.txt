 Here's  a link to some good beginner-level WF tutorials:

Have you read the MSDN section yet?

EDIT: hehâsomeone posted the link while I was writing.

Except from the obvious MSDN link, you may find useful the following:

OdeToCode has several in depth articles on WWF written by Scott Allen, and in particular a good discussion of the instances where you should use a state machine to simply complex workflow logic.
