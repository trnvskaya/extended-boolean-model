Converting Plain Text to Clickable link or Link to PlainText in asp.net
asp.net html
I need your advice with converting plain text to an URL.
The scenario will be this: The user will select some entry and then click a "convert to link" button. 
The entry text the user selected will convert to (link: selected_text). I do it with JavaScript. And after that, when he clicks the Save button to save all his entry, I don't know how to store (link: selected_text) in tha database.
The URL will be like this: www.mysite.aspx?t=selected_text. 
I can convert (link: selected_text) by using replace function in code-behind. But then I don't know how to show user as clickable and also by not showing <a href="www.mysite.aspx?t=selected_text">
It can be difficult to understand therefore I will show some of my codes to explain.
Private Sub Save(ByVal Entry As String) ' Entry Comes from entry textbox '

  Dim elected As String
  selected = Entry.Replace("(link: ", "<a href http://www.mysite.com?link=")
  selected = Entry.Replace(")", ">")

  ' then here starts save but not necessary to show '

End Sub



To store in database, you'll have to track the changes separately somehow and post them back to the server.  I'd suggest a HiddenInput control.

Do not save it as www.mysite.com?t=here. Just save the entry as the user types it. While showing it to user later, convert the "(link: here)" to link and show that.

If you must save processed input for some reason
(link: here)

must be converted to
(link: <a href="http://www.mysite.com?t=here">here</a>)


Save the post as the user wrote it. This will make it easier to allow editing of the post later. When you render the message you should use a regular expression to replace it with a real link. You should never replace all ")" with ">". What happends if i write "hello (world)"?
The result:
Hello (world>
