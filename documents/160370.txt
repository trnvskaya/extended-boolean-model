What svn command would list all the files modified on a branch?
svn
In svn, I have a branch which was created, say at revision 22334. Commits were then made on the branch.
How do I get a list of all files that were changed on the branch compared to what's on the trunk? I do not want to see files that were changed on the trunk between when the branch was created and "now".


This will do it I think:
svn diff -r 22334:HEAD --summarize <url of the branch>


You can also get a quick list of changed files if thats all you're looking for using the status command with the -u option
svn status -u

This will show you what revision the file is in the current code base versus the latest revision in the repository.  I only use diff when I actually want to see differences in the files themselves.
There is a good tutorial on svn command here that explains a lot of these common scenarios: http://www.duchnik.com/tutorials/vc/svn-command-reference

-u option will display including object files if they are added during compilation.
So, to overcome that additionally you may use like this.
svn status -u | grep -v '\?' 


This will list only modified files:
svn status -u | grep M


echo You must invoke st from within branch directory
SvnUrl=`svn info | grep URL | sed 's/URL: //'`
SvnVer=`svn info | grep Revision | sed 's/Revision: //'`
svn diff -r $SvnVer --summarize $SvnUrl
