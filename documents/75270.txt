Open Source Database Plugin For Eclipse?
database eclipse ide
Does anyone know of a good open source plugin for database querying and exploring within Eclipse? 
The active Database Exploring plugin within Eclipse is really geared around being associated with a Java project. While I am just trying to run ad-hoc queries and explore the schema. I am effectively looking for a just a common, quick querying tool without the overhead of having to create a code project. I have found a couple open source database plugins for Eclipse but these have not seen active development in over a year.
Any suggestions?


I use SQL Explorer.
It comes as an Eclipse plugin or standalone.

I use Quantum DB, and it seems to work quite well.
