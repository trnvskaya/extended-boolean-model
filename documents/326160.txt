BlogEngine.Net Code Formatting Extension that works?
blogengine.net
For months now I've been trying to find a code syntax formatting extension that works for BlogEngine.Net.  I'm not fond of the behavior of the default formatting extension, and have tried a couple of others (manoli is among them), but they always seem to interact badly with the TinyMCE editor.  Does anyone know of an extension that works, or a different approach that will allow me to make code samples pretty on my blog without hacking the crap out of the HTML myself?
Thanks.


I would try using Windows Live Writer along w/ the Paste From Visual Studio plugin. One you go WLW, you'll never go back to that damn TinyMCE interface.

Thanks, Rafe.  Thanks to this post that Hanselman put up the day after I asked the question, I downloaded WLW and am now using it.  As far as getting prettily formatted code, I'm using cut-and-paste from a little tool developed and available on manoli.net.

Check out SyntaxHighlighter..  Works excellent.  For easy integration into BlogEngine have a look at my blog post.
