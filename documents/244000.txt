Apache Abdera Client - Posting/Putting
client atom apache-abdera
Looking for help using the Apache Abdera Atom Client.  I am trying to post and put files to a feed but I am getting a 400 error saying that the content type must be application/x-www-form-urlencoded or multipart/form-data


You need to check where you are posting too. Abdera is used to post ATOM-XML format. It looks like you try to post to the same URL your web form is posting to, which would be a HTML submission a.k.a. x-www-form-urlencoded. Check with the blog server software if and where they support the ATOM publishing protocol.
