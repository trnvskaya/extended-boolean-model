Vim: NERD_tree Plugin. Need help understanding a bloggers .vimrc addition to streamline this plugin
vim
So I'm basically a beginner when it comes to Vim, nonetheless I do know the basic things (open files, edit, move around, basic grep, .vimrc, etc)
I would submit this link first
http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2008/11/17/vim-follow-up
If you scroll down to where it says "NERD___tree", it explains what it is and gives a link to the home page. I have already gotten NERD_tree installed, so far so good.
Only thing is, this guy (JamisBuck) adds a line to the .vimrc file to streamline it's usage (I'm guessing to toggle between NERD_tree and the actual file, because as far as I can tell, there is no quick way to do it other than typing in:
:NERDTree

Every time which is less than desirable. The follwing is the code he adds to the .vimrc file:
map <leader>d :execute 'NERDTreeToggle ' . getcwd()<CR>

He doesn't explain exactly what is is and/or how to use it, so If someone could give me a short explanation and/or point me towards a resource to learn more about this, that would be appreciated.


I'd say :help leader will give you what you need,  is an anti-slash by default.
Thus, map <leader>d will be launched when you do \d.

According to the vim documentation, the 
<Leader>

Is a special variable that is replaced with the value of "mapleader" at the time the mapping is defined. So: 
map <leader>d :execute 'NERDTreeToggle ' . getcwd()<CR>

Is mapping the mapleader and "d" to the toggle. If you look at the page you linked, earlier in the page he says: 
Iâve got my <Leader> character (:h mapleader) mapped to the comma 
(since itâs easier to reach than the backspace character).

let mapleader = ","

So the toggle should be ",d" as far as I can tell.

In addition to what others have said (d mapped to the command), the command, itself:
:execute 'NERDTreeToggle ' . getcwd()<CR>

Is simply executing the NERDTreeToggle command with the first argument as the current working directory. The  at the end is a carriage return, and is just simulating a press of the enter key.
This means that when NERD tree opens, it will be in the current working directory.
