What is the best way to separate UI (designer/editor) logic from the Package framework (like Visual Studio Package)
visual-studio design user-interface vsx
I want to separate concerns here. Create and embed all the UI logic for the Custom XML designer, object model, validations etc in to a separate assembly. Then the Package framework should only register the designer information and ask for a UI Service and everything works magically.
This way I don't need to play with the Package framework (Visual Studio Package) assembly, when I need to modify the UI designer.
This question also applies to anything where you have to separate the UI logic from the Skeleton framework that loads it up, like a plugin.
I have several choices a ServiceProvider model, a plugin model or may be other.
Any samples, suggestions for patterns, links are welcome.
Update 1: What I am looking for is a thought such as - "Does Prism (Composite WPF) fit the bill? Has anyone worked on a project/application which does the separation of concerns just like I mentioned above? etc" 
(I am still looking out for answers)


What you're asking about seams very much like the separation of concerns that the MVC pattern tries to enforce.
ASP.NET MVC is already out there with a preview 5.
It's mainly for web but I think they are planning on using it also for WinForms, but I'm not sure.

I've created a VSPackage that loads an editor. The Editor sits in a separate assembly and implements an interface that I defined. The VSPackage works with the interface, so any changes I make to the editor (and its assembly) does not affect the VSPackage as long as I don't change the interface.

I prefer the Model View Presenter pattern
