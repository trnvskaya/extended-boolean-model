jetty - reload tag file in jar
java jetty tagfile
I have my main web project and a common project which houses my tag files. Currently I use jetty in exploded structure and I jar up my common project with my tag files and place into web-inf/lib.
When I make a change to my tag file, I can rejar and place into web-inf/lib again, though jetty is failing.
javax.servlet.ServletException: org.apache.jasper.JasperException: PWC6033: Unable to compile class for JSP

How can I set up jetty so I can rejar my tag files without restarting the server?


A possible reason Jetty is unable to compile the JSP file is because it's running under a JRE instead of a JDK. It needs access to the compiler (which is not part of the JRE just the JDK) to turn JSP source into bytecode (with a Servlet step in between).
