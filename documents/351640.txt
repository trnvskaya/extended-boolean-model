How to install Hibernate Tools in Eclipse?

What is the proper way to install Hibernate Tools in Eclipse as a plugin?
The Hibernate site doesn't really give any instructions.
Looking at the Hibernate Tools binary HibernateTools-3.2.4.Beta1-R200810311334.zip, it appears that I can just unzip this in my eclipse directory. Do I just unzip it in my eclipse directory? This seems like a hacky was to install it.


For Eclipse plugins, you just unzip them and drop the folder in the Eclipse\Plugins directory. Simple as that.

Since it is for Ganymede (eclipse 3.4), I would advise to uncompress the zip in the dropins in the HibernateTools-3.2.4.Beta1-R20081031133 directory created after the name of the archive.
Once it is done, create in the [eclipse\dropins\HibernateTools-3.2.4.Beta1-R20081031133] an 'eclipse' directory, in which you will move the plugins and features directories creating at the extraction of the files of the archive.
Add a .exclipseextension in [eclipse\dropins\HibernateTools-3.2.4.Beta1-R20081031133\eclipse]:
name=QuickRex
id=org.hibernate.eclipse
version=3.2.4b1

So:
eclipse
    dropins
         HibernateTools-3.2.4.Beta1-R20081031133
             eclipse
                 .eclipseextension
                 features
                 plugins

Relaunch eclipse and the plugin Hibernate should be detected.
If you install another eclipse, just copy the content of your dropins directory to the new eclipse\dropins and your set of plugins will be detected again.

uncompress the zip  HibernateTools-3.2.4.Beta1-R20081031133
later in eclipse
 --> menu Help -> Update Sofwate -> add site -> local add, and select de folder uncompress an install automatic

Well, most convenient and safest way is to use JBoss update site within Eclipse software updates (Help -> Software Updates... -> Add Site...):
The latest stable release update site for JBoss Tools
There you can find Hibernate tools together with other handy JBoss plugins.

Once you have copied the plugins and features folder to eclipse (eg. c:\program files\eclipse (or whereever you installed it). You will see a features and plugins folder there already) you can check if hibernate has installed by going to Help > Software updates > installed software. If hibernate is not listed close eclipse and launch it again via a command window with this command "eclipse -clean". 


I can't for the life of me get the Next or Finish button to not go grey

This is the eclipse pain in the ass UI. If you unckecked previously some components because they have broken dependencies, it blocks in the license. You have to unselect them in the first step.
Note that avoid to use the update feature of Eclipse it broke all my plugin, I had to delete my ./eclipse folder and reinstall all.

Menu Help > Install new software
Use this url : http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/stable/

Find the stable version of the hibernate plugin (Zip or URL for auto update) in the below URL.
http://www.jboss.org/tools/download
Do not install everything though. You just need:

The entire All JBoss Tools 3.2.0 section
Hibernate Tools (HT) from Application Development
HT from Data Services
JBoss Maven Hibernate Configurator from Maven Support and 
HT from Web and Java EE Development

That's all!
In 2013, you will be probably using the latest versions of Eclipse and Hibernate. For Eclipse-4.2.2. and JBoss Tools 4.0 you need:

From the Abridged JBoss Tools 4.0, the JBoss Hibenate Tools section
Hibernate Tools (HT) from Application Development
HT from JBoss Data Services
JBoss Maven Hibernate Configurator from Maven Support and 
HT from Web and Java EE Development

Then you are ready to go!

I'm running Eclipse Indigo 64 bit on Windows 7 64 bit and I kept getting missing dependency errors associated with Maven and other plugins using the JBoss Tools 3.3.X latest download.  Here is the link.
So, I opted to only install Hibernate Tools with nothing else by typing in "hibernate" at the top of the install software dialog in eclipse.  Only 4 items showed up, so that is all I installed.  It worked fine with no problems.  Here is the tutorial that I used to get it installed properly after several failed attempts.
I don't know if part of this was due to having a lot of plugins already installed or if this is the best solution or not, but I thought I'd share it with everyone.

Instructions for Eclipse Indigo:

Help -> Install New Software
Click on Add. Location:  http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/stable/
Inside JBoss Web and Java EE Development folder, select Hibernate Tools
Click on Next

Once installed click on Window -> Show View -> Others. A new window pops up. Click on folder Hibernate and select Hibernate Configurations to setup a DB connection. It is possible to setup a new connection using an existing Hiberbate properties file or creating a JDBC connection.
Once setup your DB connection click on Ping to test everything is correct.
Lastly, click on the Open HQL Editor button (third button on the top Hibernate Configurations menu) to run a HQL query.

Documented the different possible ways and U can look them at.

Hope steps with pictures can serve even better

Method-1 Online Hibernate Tool Installation

In Eclipse IDE, menu bar, select Help >> Install New Software â¦ put the Eclipse update site URL "download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/stable/Eclipse_Versionâ

Select the tool and click on Next. Do not select all the tools; it will install all the unnecessary tools. We just need hibernate tools.
Accept licence agreement and click finish.It will take some minutes to complete installation process.

After installation, restart the eclipse to verify whether Hibernate tools is installed properly,we will look at Hibernate Perspective in Eclipse->>Window->>Open Perspective->>Other
Method-2 Offline Installation

If you donât have the internet connection and want the offline method to add hibernate tools in eclipse. To install the Hibernate Tools, extract the HibernateTools-5.X.zip file and move all the files inside the features folder into the features folder of the eclipse installation directory and move all the files inside the plugins folder into the plugins folder of the ecilpse installation directory.
After restart, Go to Eclipse->>Window->>Open Perspective->>Other, the following dialog box appears, select Hibernate and click the Ok button.

Thatâs it . We successfully installed JBoss Hibernate Tools in Eclipse. :) now Happy Coding
