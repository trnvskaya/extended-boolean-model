Safe to Run LogParser Against Live Production IIS Log?

Is it safe to run LogParser against our live production IIS log file?
Currently, I have been copying it over to another location and then running LogParser 2.2 against the log file.
Instead, I would really like to run it against the live data so that I can see changes to it immediately, however, I am a little concerned that it might cause issues.
Does anyone know if querying the live IIS logs would cause a problem?


It shouldn't cause any problems as I don't believe it locks the file.  Why would it be a problem to copy the file though just to make sure?  Even if you just copy it to a local folder, a batch file could make that easy, to copy the file and run it through logparser.
But it should be fine against live files.

It's definitely safe, since as Tom says Log Parser does not lock input files. Running in production on live log files was a key target scenario.
