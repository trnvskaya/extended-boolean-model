Writing a language for the Windows Scripting Host (WSH)
programming-languages wsh scripting-language
Has anyone had any experience targetting WSH in the way that VBScript, JScript, PerlScript, xbScript and ForthScript (among other) do, such that the language can be used from the command line and embedded in server-side web pages? Where do I go to get that kind of information? 


These are called Windows Script Engines and are implemented by exposing the engine via COM.  There is a lot documentation on MSDN, and the actual interfaces are fairly straight forward.
