Can you write a block of c++ code inside C#?
c# .net c++
I heard somewhere that you can drop down to C++ directly inside C# code. 
How is this done?  Or did I hear wrong?
Note: I do not mean C++ / CLI.


You heard incorrectly.

You might be thinking of unsafe blocks where you can write code that looks a lot like  C++, since you can use pointers.

Why would you need to do that? You can reference native C libraries, but I doubt very much that you can run native code from within managed code.

You can interact with COM objects very easily from .NET.

You can drop down to Assembly from C, because C is instruction-set-semi-agnostic Assembly.
You can drop down to C from C++, because C++ is C plus some other things that make it divinely ugly or horrifically beautiful, depending on your perspective.
You can't drop down from C# to C++, because they are entirely different things. There is no direct relation between them, aside from the curly-brackets-and-semicolons syntax. C# is not a superset of C++, nor a subset of it, nor a sibling of it (but perhaps a second cousin).
That said, C# provides facilities for interacting with external code at all levels of abstraction, from Platform-Invoke (calling functions written in C) to COM to a wide variety of other kinds. But C# itself is not directly related to these things.
