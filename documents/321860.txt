How to remove elements from xml using xslt with stylesheet and xsltproc?
xml xslt
I have a lot of XML files which have something of the form:

< Element  
    fruit="apple"  
    animal="cat" 
/>

Which I want to be removed from the file.
Using an XSLT stylesheet and the Linux command-line utility xsltproc, how could I do this?
By this point in the script I already have the list of files containing the element I wish to remove, so the single file can be used as a parameter.

EDIT: the question was originally lacking in intention.
What I am trying to achieve is to remove the entire element "Element" where (fruit=="apple" && animal=="cat"). In the same document there are many elements named "Element", I wish for these to remain. So

< Element  
    fruit="orange"  
    animal="dog" 
/>
< Element  
    fruit="apple"  
    animal="cat" 
/>  
< Element  
    fruit="pear"  
    animal="wild three eyed mongoose of kentucky" 
/>

Would become:

< Element  
    fruit="orange"  
    animal="dog" 
/>
< Element  
    fruit="pear"  
    animal="wild three eyed mongoose of kentucky" 
/>



Using one of the most fundamental XSLT design patterns: "Overriding the identity transformation" one will just write the following:

<xsl:stylesheet version="1.0"
 xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform">

 <xsl:output omit-xml-declaration="yes"/>

    <xsl:template match="node()|@*">
      <xsl:copy>
         <xsl:apply-templates select="node()|@*"/>
      </xsl:copy>
    </xsl:template>

    <xsl:template match="Element[@fruit='apple' and @animal='cat']"/>
</xsl:stylesheet>

Do note how the second template overrides the identity (1st) template only for elements named "Element" that have an attribute "fruit" with value "apple" and attribute "animal" with value "cat". This template has empty body, which means that the matched element is simply ignored (nothing is produced when it is matched).
When this transformation is applied on the following source XML document:

<doc>... 
    <Element name="same">foo</Element>...
    <Element fruit="apple" animal="cat" />
    <Element fruit="pear" animal="cat" />
    <Element name="same">baz</Element>...
    <Element name="same">foobar</Element>...
</doc>

the wanted result is produced:

<doc>... 
    <Element name="same">foo</Element>...
    <Element fruit="pear" animal="cat"/>
    <Element name="same">baz</Element>...
    <Element name="same">foobar</Element>...
</doc>
