Volume (Balance) Control for XP/Vista
c++ windows windows-vista audio
Is there a method for controlling the Balance of the Wave output that will work on both XP and Vista?


Vista has a new api for everything related to mixers and audio, per process legacy api's should still work, but to change global volume, you would have to look at the new COM interfaces added to Vista
This should get you started

have you looked at this?

waveOutSetVolume
The waveOutSetVolume function sets the
  volume level of the specified
  waveform-audio  output device.

It uses Winmm.lib.
