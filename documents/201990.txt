How can I determine the last time any record changed in a specific Sql Server 2000 database?
sql sql-server-2000
I have a SQL Server 2000 database instance that is rarely updated.  I also have a database table which has no columns holding each row's created date or modified date.  
Is there any way that I can determine the last time an update or insert was performed on the database as a whole, so that I can at least put a bound on when the specific records in the table may have changed?
Note:  I am looking for information about transactions that have already occurred.  Triggers may help we should I require this again in the future, but does not address the problem I'm trying to describe.
If it can be done, how can I do it?


Depending on the size of the database and the number of tables you could put a trigger in place that would handle updates/or inserts and log that to another table, potentially logging the table name and a timestamp, it isn't elegant but could work.  and Doesn't require any modification to the rest of the db.

The database's log file may have some information that is useful to your quest.  AFAIK, the database itself doesn't store a "last updated" date.
