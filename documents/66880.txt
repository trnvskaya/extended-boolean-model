How to test credit card interactions?
testing credit-card
After reading this answer, I wonder if there's a way to get a "testing" credit card number.  One that you can experiment with but that doesn't actually charge anything.


Most payment gateways provide such numbers for testing their services, but they will generally only work on the staging/test versions of those gateways.

Most payment processors provide either a testing number (PayPal does this) or the ability to go into testing mode (in which no transactions actually get processed).  Consult the documentation.

Depending on your payment gateway, there are two ways to test a transaction.
For example, with authorize.net, if you send "X_TEST_TRANSACTION=true" (or something like that, its been a long time), with your POST, it will run it in test mode.
They also provide a test VISA and test Mastercard number that will always come back as approved if in test mode, and declined in production mode.
Look at your gateway API documentation, it will be clearly detailed there.
