What do you call the tags in Subversion and CVS that add automatic content?
svn tags cvs
Things like $log$ and $version$ which add data upon check-in to the file. I'm interested in seeing the other ones and what information they can provide, but I can't get much info unless I know what they are called.


Both Subversion and CVS call them Keywords.
Have a look in the SVN manual here (scroll down to svn:keywords) or here for CVS.

In SVN these are simply called "properties". You can read about them in the SVN book:
http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.8/svn.advanced.props.html

Err, so, are they called properties or keywords? Oh, I see. In SVN you can associate arbitrary metadata, called "properties", with versioned files; some of the properties you can set are to set up keyword substitution in the files themselves.

These are Keyword substitutions. The link to SVNBook 1.8 is here: http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.8/svn.advanced.props.special.keywords.html.
Subversion's built-in keywords are:

Date / LastChangedDate
Revision / Rev / LastChangedRevision
Author / LastChangedBy
HeadURL / URL
Id

The keywords are case sensitive, and remember to surround them with $.
