Sliding Notification bar in java (a la Firefox)
java swing user-interface notifications notification-bar
I would like to implement a sliding notification bar as the one in Firefox or IE for my java application. But I don't want to reinvent the wheel and I'm sure someone out there has already done it and is willing to share.
Do you know any open-source implementation of this in java/swing?


There's an example in Swing Hacks called "Slide Notes Out from the Taskbar" that seems pretty close to what you want (there's a preview on Google's Book Search at the moment).  
The code is freely available from the official O'Reilly Swing Hacks page, under "examples."  Not sure what the license is, but it's worth a look (Chapter 6, hack 46).  At any rate, Swing Hacks is a worthy purchase at ~$20.

A standard way to do it is to use Swing TrayIcon API. That would probably be the most convenient way too :)
