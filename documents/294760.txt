How do you show animated gifs with .NET Compact Framework
.net animation compact-framework picturebox
I would like to display an animated gif on a .NET Compact Form.
Currently I use a PictureBox control and toggle between 
.Visible = true and .Visible = false.
After .Visible = true the gif is shown however it's not animated. How can I get the .NET Compact Framework to animate it?
I already tried this but it doesn't work.


By default the .Net Compact framework does not support displaying GIF based animations on a Windows Form.  It is possbile to code up a custom animator that will essentially do the same.  Here's a link to a sample class for displaying a GIF on the compact framework.
