Berkley packet filter for Windows
windows sniffing
Is Berkley Packet Filter supported on Windows or is there something comparable which I should use?


For windows there is WinPCap that could help you do the same thing.
On XP SP2 and Vista there is the limitation that only administrators can create raw packets.
