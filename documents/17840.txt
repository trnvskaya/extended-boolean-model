How can I learn about parser combinators?
parsing monads
I've found a few resources on the subject, but they all require a deep understanding of SmallTalk or Haskell, neither of which I know.


I found an interesting article about implementing a parser combinator in C#. It also references some more general papers on the subject.
The Wikipedia article on the subject also has a general explaination of the concept. 

Here are some parser combinator libraries in more mainstream languages:

Spirit (C++)
Jparsec (Java)


I wrote 8 longish blog entries on monadic parser combinators in C# and F#; see here for the first one.
See also FParsec (Parsec for F#)

If you know Python, there's PyParsing.

Chrise Double wrote a parser combinator in Javascript.

Cay Horstmann has 4 combinator parser lectures in Scala, with exercises. There is an example of parsing external DSLs in Scala here.

Here is a link to a talk (slides and script) on monadic parser combinators in C++.

There are some great articles on the web describing parser combinators in C#, but no maintainable source repository, so I've created one at:
http://code.google.com/p/sprache/
Someone knowledgeable about parser combinators could probably do a lot to improve it (please step forward if this sounds like you :))

For me this paper was extremly useful. It is almost languange neutral. Just in some small places they are reffering to Gofer.
