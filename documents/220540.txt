Tibco & Windows Process Activation
messaging tibco wpas
I'm thinking about how I could scale out Tibco EMS queue listeners written in managed code (C# in this instance). I'm looking for predominantly isolation and clustering characteristics.
In MSMQ I could use Windows Process Activation Service to host and manage the number and lifetime of queue listeners.  Is there a Tibco equivalent?
Otherwise I suspect I'll end up with a simple NT service to host EMS listeners. (which in turn could perform process-activation).   Workable but fairly tricky to build a 24x7 monitorable, robust, production service.


If I understand your question correctly, then the TIBCO equivalent is TIBCO ActiveMatrix Service Grid. It supports C# service containers and can host and manage your C# listeners.
Couple this with TIBCO ActiveMatrix Service Performance Manager and you can have it automatically deploy and start more instances to more nodes during high load situations.
