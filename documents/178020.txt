How do I embed a Google map into a Flash website?
flash actionscript google-maps
I would like to include a Google map in a Flash site I am building. I would like to retain as much of the zoom, print, copy/send url, direction functionality as is practically possible. Please could somebody advise the best way to do this? Thanks.


I have seen google maps on flash. May be you can buy some kind of component.

See Google Maps API for Flash

This API lets Flex developers embed
  Google Maps in Flash applications.
  Similar to the JavaScript version,
  this ActionScript API provides a
  number of utilities for manipulating
  and adding content to maps through a
  variety of services, enabling you to
  embed robust, interactive maps
  applications on your website.


Stamen developed a "BSD-licensed display and interaction library for tile-based maps in Flash (ActionScript 2.0 and ActionScript 3.0) and Python" called ModestMaps
While not the best choice for Google maps, it also supports Open Street Map, Yahoo, as well as MS maps.
