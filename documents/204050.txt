MSSQL2000: get list of role members
sql sql-server sql-server-2000
I know a role name and want to find all users in this role. 
How do I acheive this in SQL Server 2000 (in the SQL script, not in Management Studio or other tool)?


You can use the following stored procedures:
For fixed server roles, the stored procedure is sp_helpsrvrolemember:
exec sp_helpsrvrolemember 'role'

For general roles, the stored procedure is sp_helprolemember:
exec sp_helprolemember 'role'


Just use SQL-DMO:
Replace rolename with your role
exec sp_helprolemember rolename
