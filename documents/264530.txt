How to find two adjacent repeating digits and replace them with a single digit in Java?
java regex string
I need to find two adjacent repeating digits in a string and replace with a single one. How to do this in Java. Some examples:
123345 should be 12345
 77433211 should be 74321


using a regex:
var myString='123345'
myString.replace(/([0-9])\1/g,'$1')

that will match exactly 2 repeats.
'123334'.replace(/([0-9])\1+/g,'$1')


Probably a replaceAll("(\\d)\\1+", "$1")

$ plays a special role in a replacing string, designating the first capturing group.
+ allows for replacing as many identical number as possible (\\d)\\1 would only replace them by pair: 777xx => 77xx (thank you Ben Doom for the remark)

So:
System.out.println("77433211".replaceAll("(\\d)\\1+", "$1"));

will return
74321


String java.lang.String.replaceAll(String regex, String replacement)

Replaces each substring of this string that matches the given regular expression with the given replacement. 
An invocation of this method of the form str.replaceAll(regex, repl) yields exactly the same result as the expression 
java.util.regex.Pattern.compile(regex).matcher(str).replaceAll(repl)


Warning: String.replaceAll() function does not modify the String on which it is applied. It returns a modified String (or a new String with the same content if the pattern does not match anything)
So you need to affect the result of a replaceAll() call to itself to actually update your String with the regexp changes.
String aString = "77433211"
aString = aString.replaceAll("(\\d)\\1+", "$1"));


This is a regular expression mathing two repeating digits (x being the digit)
[x]{2}(?!=[x])


I finally did it myself. Those who are looking for the solution, this is how I did it:
import java.util.regex.*;

public class RepetingDigits{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String word = "77433211";
        Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("(\\d)\\1");
        Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(word);
        word = matcher.replaceAll("$1");  
        System.out.println(word);
    }
}

Even simpler:
**word = word.replaceAll("(\\d)\\1", "$1");**
