Is there a way to expand the code window in VS.NET to maximum size?
visual-studio-2008
In Eclipse you can double-click on the tab of the code window and expand it to full size, e.g. if you will be working on just the code awhile and want maximum size on a smaller monitor, etc.
Is there a way to expand the code window in Visual Studio.NET in one click (otherwise I have to collapse Toolbox, Solution Explorer, Properties, etc.)


Shift+Alt+Enter takes you to full screen mode, which hides most panes. The only two I had were a close window history and my pending check-ins, but for the most part this works well.

Josh's suggestion also works on VS2005.
