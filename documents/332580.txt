Generating large sets of random data vb6/vb net
vb.net vb6
Is there an easy way in either language to generate a large set of random data quickly so far all the functions I've tried haven't worked too well when I need to generate a group of say 500,000 characters :(  Any ideas?


Use UUIDGen. At least the chunks will be bigger.


Use UUIDGen.

Don't. GUIDs aren't really random. You can actually generate large amounts of data very fast using the System.Random class in VB.NET. 500,000 characters/bytes are no problem:
Dim buffer As Byte() = Nothing
Array.Resize(buffer, 500000)
Call New Random().NextBytes(buffer)
My.Computer.FileSystem.WriteAllBytes("filename", buffer, False)

This code takes considerably less than one second.

In VB6 the code would go something like this
Public Function FillRandomCol() as Collection
    Dim C As Collection
    Dim I As Long
    Set C = New Collection
    Randomize Timer
    For I = 1 To 500000
        C.Add RandomChar
    Next I
    Set FillRandomCol = C
End Sub

Public Function Random(ByVal Number As Integer) As Integer
    Random = CLng(Rnd * 1000000) Mod Number + 1
End Function

Public Function RandomChar() As String
    Const AlphaNum = "0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
    RandomChar = Mid$(AlphaNum, Random(36), 1)
End Function

Takes 1/2 second on a 2 Core Intel 2.40 GHz computer.
