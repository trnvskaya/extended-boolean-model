Is it possible to have different members in a class document have different colours?
visual-studio-2008
I am using visual studio 2008 professional and was wondering, how can I have different colours for method calls within class methods, and for properties/fields? This would be good as it would give me a quick visual overview of what my class has too much of (e.g. 20 fields and 2 methods - which will give me some interesting information on my design - not that I do this, anyway).
Ideally, I'd like to have these members highlighted, as when you step through.
Thanks


Out of the box, I do not believe it is possible in Visual Studio 2008. You might need an aftermarket addon to implement this specific functionality. You could always look into Visual Assist X, although it is a commercial product.
