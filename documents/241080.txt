How to use SQL_ASCII encoding in a rails application?
ruby-on-rails postgresql encoding character-encoding
I have to connect to a legacy postgre database wich has ENCODING = 'SQL_ASCII';. How do I set this encoding in my rails app?


You can set this in your database.yml:
development:
  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: sql_ascii
  database: appname_development
  username: root
  password:
  host: localhost
