cfront for C++
c++ c cfront
Is a cfront tool available for the new C++? For any other modern languages?


What do you mean by âcfront toolâ? Cfront was the first C++ compiler. But since failure to add exception support, it has been discontinued. Modern C++ is way beyond the scope of Cfront.

For any other modern languages?

And what do you mean by that? If you mean whether other compilers exist that compile a high-level language into C code then the answer is yes, there are plenty. The Glasgow Haskell Compiler is just one out of many.

I believe a number of languages, at least in their infancy, just "compile" to C code, letting a good compiler (often gcc...) to generate optimized native code. I think GHC is (for some implementations?) such language, and there are some others I don't recall.
I know also lua2c, converting Lua code to C.

Comeau C/C++ is a C-generating C++ compiler, like cfront.
