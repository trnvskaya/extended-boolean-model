How to remove paths from tabs in Visual Studio 2008?

Is there a way to stop the path showing in a source code tab in Visual Studio 2008?
Currently when developing an ASP.NET site, I get the path from the root plus the filename - truncated when it gets too long. So something like:

MyDir/MyPage.aspx

for a short path and filename, or:

MyDir/MyLong...yPage.aspx

for a longer path and filename.
I'd prefer to see just the filename (ie just MyPage.aspx), allowing more tabs to show at once and making it easier to see which files I have open without using the drop-down list or Crtl-Tab to show the full set.
In VS2005, I just get the filename - no path however long it is. Oddly in VS2003 I get the path and filename. I've scoured the options and I can't find a setting that lets me change what appears in the tabs. Searching suggests that other people have similar issues (although which version it occurs in appears to differ) but no-one could identify an option to change what appears.
Can anyone point me in the right direction to get rid of the paths in the tabs (or confirm that it can't be changed to save me wasting more time searching)?


In my copy of VS 2008 I just get the filename, not the path.  I wonder whether it's a "web site" vs "web application" thing.  Which one are you working in?  Can you create a project of the other type and see if it still happens?  (I'm working in a web application where I get filename-only.)

It looks like Microsoft does not allow to do it using the standard method. I'm know ReSharper allows this, but installing a big plugin for this is a bad idea. I think I have sinse found a small plugin which allows show or hide the full path. I am sure this should exist.

Tabs Studio add-in can remove path from tab in Visual Studio 2008.
