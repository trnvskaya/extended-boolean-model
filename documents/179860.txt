Problem with width of auto-generated columns in DataGrid
asp.net
Maybe world peace would be easier, but I have a problem with the widths of auto generated columns when a DataGrid has no rows.  The column headings all squeeze up with no spacing between them.  I've tried adding the following CSS to no avail:
td.gridHeader
{
  padding-left:20px;
  padding-right: 20px;        
}



I beleive headings are rendered as <th> not <td>. 
th.gridHeader
{
  padding-left:20px;
  padding-right: 20px;        
}

I also assume you have applied <HeaderStyle CssClass="gridHeader" /> in the DataGrid markup. I didn't think people used DataGrids anymnore? or is it actually a GridView ?
