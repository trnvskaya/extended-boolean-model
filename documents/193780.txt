How to find all the tables in MySQL with specific column names in them?
mysql information-schema
I have 2-3 different column names that I want to look up in the entire DB and list out all tables which have those columns. Any easy script?


SELECT TABLE_NAME, COLUMN_NAME
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE column_name LIKE 'wild'


To get all tables with columns columnA or ColumnB in the database YourDatabase:
SELECT DISTINCT TABLE_NAME 
    FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
    WHERE COLUMN_NAME IN ('columnA','ColumnB')
        AND TABLE_SCHEMA='YourDatabase';


SELECT DISTINCT TABLE_NAME, COLUMN_NAME  
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS  
WHERE column_name LIKE 'employee%'  
AND TABLE_SCHEMA='YourDatabase'


In version that do not have information_schema (older versions, or some ndb's) you can dump the table structure and search the column manualy.
mysqldump -h$host -u$user -p$pass --compact --no-data --all-databases > some_file.sql

Now search the column name in some_file.sql using your prefered text editor, or use some nifty awk scripts :)

And a simple sed script to find the column, just replace COLUMN_NAME with your's:
sed -n '/^USE/{h};/^CREATE/{H;x;s/\nCREATE.*\n/\n/;x};/COLUMN_NAME/{x;p};' <some_file.sql
USE `DATABASE_NAME`;
CREATE TABLE `TABLE_NAME` (
  `COLUMN_NAME` varchar(10) NOT NULL,

You can pipe the dump directly in sed but that's trivial.

More simply done in one line of SQL:
SELECT * FROM information_schema.columns WHERE column_name = 'column_name';


For those searching for the inverse of this, i.e. looking for tables that do not contain a certain column name, here is the query...
SELECT DISTINCT TABLE_NAME FROM information_schema.columns WHERE 
TABLE_SCHEMA = 'your_db_name' AND TABLE_NAME NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT 
TABLE_NAME FROM information_schema.columns WHERE column_name = 
'column_name' AND TABLE_SCHEMA = 'your_db_name');

This came in really handy when we began to slowly implement use of InnoDB's special ai_col column and needed to figure out which of our 200 tables had yet to be upgraded.

If u want "To get all tables only" , Then use this query
 
SELECT TABLE_NAME 
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
WHERE TABLE_NAME like '%'
and TABLE_SCHEMA = 'tresbu_lk'



If u want "To get all tables with Columns" , Then use this query
 
SELECT DISTINCT TABLE_NAME, COLUMN_NAME  
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS  
WHERE column_name LIKE '%'  
AND TABLE_SCHEMA='tresbu_lk'
