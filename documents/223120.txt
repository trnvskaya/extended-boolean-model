How can I view more than one version of IE on my computer?
internet-explorer internet-explorer-6 internet-explorer-7
Where I work we only have IE 7. I want to view  IE 6 on my computer also. 
How can I view both on the same computer? 
I want more than just a screen shot. I want to view both versions of IE as I write code.


You want Multiple IE... IE3 to 6 in one package!

Microsoft makes available virtual machine images that can be used with the also free Virtual PC program for each version of IE to be used by testers. You can find these here:

I used to use Multiple IE, but have found some limitations - it only handles the browser window display functionality, but it doesn't show you the print preview and has some other limitations.
So I suggest Virtual PC.  It's free and you can find a Win XP w/ IE6 image for free as well.

While MultipleIEs works for most situations, it is best to run each version you need to support in a VM as it is supposed to be installed. This way you avoid some bugs in the standalone implementations such as problems with cookies, some forms being uneditable, conditional comments being a crap shoot, that sort of thing.

Try IETester. It supports IE5.5, IE6, IE7 and IE8 beta all in the one program.

Here is a listing of different versions of IE, you can download and unzip: http://browsers.evolt.org/?ie/32bit/standalone
I have a standalone version of IE6 in my Windows install that I just double click the IE6 executable and it runs smoothly.
