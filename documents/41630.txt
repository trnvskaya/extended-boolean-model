is it possible to concat arguments to a command line using backquotes ?
ruby command-line command-line-interface
I would like to execute an OS command from my ruby script but I want to add an argument from a ruby variable.
I know that's possible by using keyword system like that :
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
directory = '/home/paulgreg/'
system 'ls ' + directory

but is that possible by using the "backquotes or backticks syntax" ?
(I mean by using that syntax : ls)


No, that will just concatenate the output from ls and the contents of directory.
But you can do this:
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
directory = '/home/paulgreg/'
`ls #{directory}`


`ls #{directory}`

isn't very safe because you're going to run into problems with path names that have spaces in them.  
It's safer to do something like this:
directory = '/home/paulgreg/'

args = []
args << "/bin/ls"
args << directory

system(*args)


Nick is right, but there is no need to assemble the args piecewise:
directory = '/Volumes/Omg a space/'
system('/bin/ls', directory)
