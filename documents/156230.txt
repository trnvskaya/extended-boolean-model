Python Dependency Injection Framework
python dependency-injection
Is there a framework equivalent to Guice (http://code.google.com/p/google-guice) for Python?


I haven't used it, but the Spring Python framework is based on Spring and implements Inversion of Control.
There also appears to be a Guice in Python project: snake-guice

Besides that:

Zope component architekture
pyContainer


Spring Python is an offshoot of the Java-based Spring Framework and Spring Security, targeted for Python. This project currently contains the following features:

Inversion Of Control (dependency injection) - use either classic XML, or the python @Object decorator (similar to the Spring JavaConfig subproject) to wire things together. While the @Object format isn't identical to the Guice style (centralized wiring vs. wiring information in each class), it is a valuable way to wire your python app.
Aspect-oriented Programming - apply interceptors in a horizontal programming paradigm (instead of vertical OOP inheritance) for things like transactions, security, and caching.
DatabaseTemplate - Reading from the database requires a monotonous cycle of opening cursors, reading rows, and closing cursors, along with exception handlers. With this template class, all you need is the SQL query and row-handling function. Spring Python does the rest.
Database Transactions - Wrapping multiple database calls with transactions can make your code hard to read. This module provides multiple ways to define transactions without making things complicated.
Security - Plugin security interceptors to lock down access to your methods, utilizing both authentication and domain authorization.
Remoting - It is easy to convert your local application into a distributed one. If you have already built your client and server pieces using the IoC container, then going from local to distributed is just a configuration change.
Samples - to help demonstrate various features of Spring Python, some sample applications have been created:

PetClinic - Spring Framework's sample web app has been rebuilt from the ground up using python web containers including: CherryPy. Go check it out for an example of how to use this framework. (NOTE: Other python web frameworks will be added to this list in the future).
Spring Wiki - Wikis are powerful ways to store and manage content, so we created a simple one as a demo!
Spring Bot - Use Spring Python to build a tiny bot to manage the IRC channel of your open source project.



As an alternative to monkeypatching, I like DI. A nascent project such as http://code.google.com/p/snake-guice/ may fit the bill.
Or see the blog post Dependency Injection in Python by Dennis Kempin (Aug '08).

If you just want to do dependency injection in Python, you don't need a framework. Have a look at Dependency Injection the Python Way. It's really quick and easy, and only c. 50 lines of code.

There is a somewhat Guicey python-inject project. It's quite active, and a LOT less code then Spring-python, but then again, I haven't found a reason to use it yet.

If you prefer a really tiny solution there's a little function, it is just a dependency setter. 
https://github.com/liuggio/Ultra-Lightweight-Dependency-Injector-Python

Here is a small example for a dependency injection container that does constructor injection based on the constructor argument names:
http://code.activestate.com/recipes/576609-non-invasive-dependency-injection/

I like this simple and neat framework.
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/injector/

Dependency injection as a formal pattern is less useful in Python than
  in other languages, primarily due to its support for keyword
  arguments, the ease with which objects can be mocked, and its dynamic
  nature.
That said, a framework for assisting in this process can remove a lot
  of boiler-plate from larger applications. That's where Injector can
  help. It automatically and transitively provides keyword arguments
  with their values. As an added benefit, Injector encourages nicely
  compartmentalized code through the use of Module s.
While being inspired by Guice, it does not slavishly replicate its
  API. Providing a Pythonic API trumps faithfulness.


There's dyject (http://dyject.com), a lightweight framework for both Python 2 and Python 3 that uses the built-in ConfigParser

pinject (https://github.com/google/pinject) is a newer alternative. It seems to be maintained by Google and follows a similar pattern to Guice (https://code.google.com/p/google-guice/), it's Java counterpart.

If you want a guice like (the new new like they say), I recently made something close in Python 3 that best suited my simple needs for a side project.
All you need is an @inject on a method (__init__ included of course).
The rest is done through annotations.
from py3njection import inject
from some_package import ClassToInject

class Demo:
    @inject
    def __init__(self, object_to_use: ClassToInject):
        self.dependency = object_to_use

demo = Demo()

https://pypi.python.org/pypi/py3njection

Will leave my 5 cents here :)
