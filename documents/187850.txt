Relocate JSF-generated javascript
jsf
I am using lots of commandLinks in my app. For them to work, JSF generates some wild Javascript ( function dpf(f) {var adp... ). Sadly, the script-tag destroys my layout. (It really does - I am sure about that).
Is there a way to force JSF to generate the script-tag somewhere else?


Maybe you can try to externalize your Javascript.
Instead of putting the Javascript code within your page, it will only include a script tag that points to a Javascript file.
To do that, modify your web.xml file to have that:
<context-param>
    <param-name>com.sun.faces.externalizeJavaScript</param-name>
    <param-value>true</param-value>
</context-param>
