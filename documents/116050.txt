Location of My Pictures
c# windows windows-vista windows-xp
How do I programatically (Using C#) find out what the path is of my My Pictures folder? 
Does this work on XP and Vista?


Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.MyPictures);

The following will return a full-path to the location of the users picture folder (Username\My Documents\My Pictures on XP, Username\Pictures on Vista)
Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.MyPictures);


Using Microsoft.VisualBasic.FileIO.SpecialDirectories.MyPictures you can get that, works in vista and XP.
