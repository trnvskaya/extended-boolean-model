How do you read a byte array from a DataRow in C#?
c# debugging bytearray tableadapter datarow
I have a DataSet with a DataTable that correctly fills a single DataRow through a TableAdapter.
I am able to pull data from the DataRow with code like this:
dataFileID = (int)this.dataFileDataRow["DataFileID"];
dataFileName = (string)this.dataFileDataRow["DataFileName"];
dataFileDate = (DateTime)this.dataFileDataRow["DataFileDate"];

I have another column called DataFile of type varbinary(max).
When I try to pull that column's data from the same DataRow as above I get nothing.
byte[] fileFromDatabase = (byte[])this.dataFileDataRow["DataFile"];

If I put a break point at this location, I can look into the dataFileDataRow, look into the ItemArray property and see that the binary data is sitting at position 5 in the ItemArray.
I have tried access the ItemArray directly using its index but the byte array is not being copied to the fileFromDatabase variable.  
I have also noticed that adding fileFromDatabase to my watch produces this error:         

"The name 'fileFromDatabase' does not exist in the current context"

The execution is still in the same block as the definition of fileFromDatabase so I do not understand how it would be out of context.
I had Visual Studio's configuration set to Release instead of Debug.  This was causing me to not see the real time debugging information I was looking for when trying to examine fileFromDatabase.  After switching from Release to Debug, I am able to see the variable in the watch now and can verify that the code above is working correctly.  


The code above works, make sure you set your debugger to compile for Debug, NOT Release.
