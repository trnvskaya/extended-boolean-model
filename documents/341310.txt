List all files changed by a particular user in subversion
svn
Is it possible to get a list of all files modified/added/deleted by a particular user?
The goal is to get an idea of what a user did for the day (or date range).


Here's an example, using the svn log command and linux sed command, with your username, 'blankman':
svn log | sed -n '/blankman/,/-----$/ p'

If you're looking to obtain this information with continual reports, using a project like StatSVN, which Patrick mentioned, is very useful.  If you're using Maven, there is a StatSCM plugin which will generate this information on your project site.

Yes. We use StatSVN for our subversion reports, and one of the reports it does is commits by developer.
TortiseSVN also lets you look at log messages by date for authors.

Here's a small script to show which files were changed by a certain user between revisions.
#!/bin/bash
# @param $1: Start revision
# @param $2: End revision
# @param $3: User
#
# Example: svn_scapegoat.sh 1000:HEAD jdoe

svn_changed()
{
    svn blame --revision $1:$2 -- $4 | grep -E "^ [0-9]* *${3} "
}

svn diff --revision $1:$2 --summarize | \
cut -c9- | \
while read path
do
    if [ -n "$(svn_changed $1 $2 $3 $path)" ]
    then
        echo "$3 changed $path"
    else
        echo "Someone else changed $path"
    fi
done


Here is the date-range version

svn log -v -r{"2011-01-01 00:00:00"}:{"2011-02-18 00:00:00"}| sed -n '/russenreaktor/,/-----$/ p'


Shek's response helped me with what I needed to do, but I found I got more accurate results with the following tweak:
svn log | sed -n '/ | blankman | /,/-----$/ p'

Otherwise, the list includes commits made by others that simply reference me by name.

I found this useful command to find a list of modified files by a given user:
svn log -v -r{2012-08-01}:HEAD 
| awk '/^r[0-9]+ / {user=$3} /./ {if (user=="username") {print}}'
| grep -E "^   M|^   G|^   A|^   D|^   C|^   U" 
| awk '{print $2}'
| sort | uniq

And the link to the original article.

Why not simply use the tortoise SVN ?
Totoise SVN --> Show Log
Add the user id on top left for which you would like to see the list of changes

This works for me:
svn log  | grep YOUR_USERNAME_HERE | awk '{print $1}' | sed s/r//g | xargs -I $ svn diff --summarize -c $ | sort | uniq


There is no need to bother with grep, sed, etc starting from Subversion 1.8. The release introduced --search option that you can use with svn log command!
The options allows you to search your repository history for:

revision's author (svn:author unversioned property),
date (svn:date unversioned property),
log message text (svn:log unversioned property),
and paths affected by the particular revision.

See SVNBook 1.8 | svn log command-line reference.

In order to see the list all files changed by a particular user in subversion for a particular directory structure, then first you need go to the that directory structure and on the right side of directory panel do a right click..
then,
go to Show Log-->on top most left corner we get filter option.
henceforth by putting the name of user you can see all the files changed by that particular user in the bottom panel.
