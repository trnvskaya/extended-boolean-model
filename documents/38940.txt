Generate field in MySQL SELECT
sql mysql
If I've got a table containing Field1 and Field2 can I generate a new field in the select statement? For example, a normal query would be:
SELECT Field1, Field2 FROM Table

And I want to also create Field3 and have that returned in the resultset... something along the lines of this would be ideal:
SELECT Field1, Field2, Field3 = 'Value' FROM Table

Is this possible at all?


SELECT Field1, Field2, 'Value' Field3 FROM Table

or for clarity
SELECT Field1, Field2, 'Value' AS Field3 FROM Table


Yes - it's very possible, in fact you almost had it!
Try:
SELECT Field1, Field2, 'Value' AS `Field3` FROM Table
