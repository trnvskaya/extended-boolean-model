Are there any tools to visualize a RDF graph? (please include a screenshot)

I'm looking for a tool that will render a RDF graph in a reasonably useful graphic format.  The primary purpose of the graphic format being inclusion into a PowerPoint slide or printing on a large plotter for management review.
I am currently using TopBraid Composer which does a reasonably well at visualizing a single entity but doesn't seem to have a clear way of visualizing the entire graph (as a whole).
Anyone know of any good solutions to this problem?

RDF Gravity is an RDF visualisation tool.
Here's a screenshot:


-Cytoscape http://www.cytoscape.org/ works well with large scale graphs and you can create a static pdf or image. 
-I also found this very interesting http://d3js.org/
It's not specific to RDF graphs, but in the examples there seems to be some cool functionality where the users could have a large degree of interaction with the data. It does however require a fair amount of JS programming knowledge.

I was looking for one too and i found this : https://gephi.org/
Pretty sure it works with rdf.

The Perl utility rdfdot, based on Graphviz, and this library, might help:
http://metacpan.org/pod/RDF::Trine::Exporter::GraphViz
https://github.com/nichtich/RDF-Trine-Exporter-GraphViz
Graphviz is able to handle thousands of nodes, and therefore might suit the scale of your problem..

Gephi was already mentioned, but I'll incode screenshots and a short description here.
Gephi can not just visualize graphs but also supports analyzing, layouting and further importing and exporting. There is a Semantic Web Import Extension that allows you to directly query (via SPARQL) or import RDF data. https://wiki.gephi.org/index.php/SemanticWebImport (You can install it directly within the program at Plugins.

There's a JavaScript Graph Visualisation Library which worked quiet nice for me: http://sigmajs.org/ It works well together with Gephi since you can Export your graph from there and import the file into SigmaJS. That way you can export your graph to an interactive web site. Example: http://fannon.de/p/smw/vis/George_Orwell_Platz_30.html

An important mention would be D3.js which has already dozends of force graph examples. But it doesn't support RDF directly, so the data has to be converted first.
A nice one is this: http://nylen.tv/d3-process-map/graph.php?dataset=les-mis
