Installing a ASP.NET application
asp.net iis
Ok, this has got to be a super simple problem.  I just can't seem to find the answer anywhere.  First - I'm not a web developer of any kind, I'm an old school c programmer - so don't flame me for what's probably something quite trivial :)
I need to write a small proof-of-concept web app using ASP.NET.  My first attempt here is to create a "Hello World!" app.  So I opened up Visual Studio, and made a new web application.  I have my Default.aspx file that calls a C# function that is inside the helloworld.dll created automatically by Visual Studio.
I installed IIS on my local machine and created a virtual directory in the wwwroot subdirectory.  I put the Default.aspx and helloworld.dll in that directory.  Now when I browse to that page I see the following.
Server Error in '/test' Application.
Parser Error

Source Error:

Obviously, IIS doesn't know where to look for the .dll or anything like that.  I just don't know how to register the .dll with IIS (or whoever manages that stuff in .net) so that it can find the functions it need.
Can someone let me know how to "install" an ASP.NET application on IIS?


Your best bet is to use 'Publish website' from the Visual Studio Solution Explorer.
Chris Lively adds: 

Just a minor add: Publish Website can
  be found by Right Clicking on the
  project name. The command will be
  named "Publish..."


I would recommend the solution of Rich B. And something else... DLLs are in a folder called "bin". Not at the root of the folder.

You do not need to move the files to the wwwroot directory manually. A virtual directory in IIS points to any folder in the file system to look for the appliction.
Follow these steps if you are using IIS6:

Open IIS
Under "Web Sites", right-click "Default Web Site"
Select "New"
Select "Virtual Directory"
Type in a name for your new app.
Select the path of your application. By default this is usually something like C:\Your Documents\Visual Stuido 2008\Projects\Your Project Name
Leave the acess permissions as they are.
Click Finish

If you browse to "http://localhost/TheNameOfTheVirtualDirectory/Default.aspx" you should be able to view the page.
