How to get partition ranges in SQL 2005
sql sql-server sql-server-2005 partitioning
I have a partitioned table in SQL Enterprise 2005. I need to query the PARTITION FUNCTION to find it's partition ranges. What SQL query will give me those values?


Got this from the SQL profiler watching the management studio generate the script for creating the function
SELECT
sprv.value AS [Value],
sprv.boundary_id AS [ID]
FROM
sys.partition_functions AS spf
INNER JOIN sys.partition_range_values sprv ON sprv.function_id=spf.function_id
WHERE
(spf.name=N'fnPartitionLast30Days')
ORDER BY
[ID] ASC
