Set server or workstation GC
garbage-collection clr
How can I configure an application, or even an entire machine, to use either the server or workstation flavor of the CLR's garbage collection? 


Have a look here.  
I recommend giving the entire series of blog posts a good read - very informative.

I should mention that I found there are two ways of handling this, either for the entire application using a .config file (application or machine), using the gcConcurrent and gcServer elements, or it can be done on a code block level using GCSettings.LatencyMode.
