Watch for addition of a referenced library to a project (Visual Studio 2008 plug-in)
visual-studio visual-studio-2008 plugins reference
I am hoping someone can help me with this. What I have been looking around for but can't seem to find is if there is someway to add an event, or anything else that will allow a visual studio plug-in to watch for an external reference to be added to a currently open solution / project? 
Or even better yet would anyone happen to know of an add-in that automatically adds all controls from a referenced dll into the visual studio toolbox?
Thanks.


I have written a macro that will change a file reference to a project reference if you add the project to the solution (and vice versa), but I don't think that's what you want?

Not exactly what you asked, but I've written a Visual Studio 2008 Integration Package, and if I recall correctly I could override the "add reference" method, as well as inherit the "reference node" and thus change its behavior, for example its constructor.
This functionality might be missing from an add-in (which is more limited than an integration package), so you might consider writing a package instead.
