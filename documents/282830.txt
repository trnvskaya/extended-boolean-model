Looking for VB.NET open source projects to learn from
vb.net unit-testing open-source
I'm looking for some small, vb.net open source projects that make good use of unit testing. Similar to this question, but for VB.NET. 
"I would like to improve my unit-testing skills by reading, examining real-world code. Could you recommend any open source projects where the source is extensively tested with unit tests?"
Thanks!
UPDATE: Also asked the question for C#  here


Not surprisingly, I believe that NUnit itself is extensively unit tested.

For some reason there are not too many VB.NET OSS projects (compared to C#). A good one you can look at however is SilverUnit, a testing framework for Silverlight written in VB.NET

here is a good starting point :)
