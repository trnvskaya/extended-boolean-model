What is the optimal productivity stack for developers?
When deciding what to include in your personal productivity stack, what criteria do you use?


The optimal stack for developers doesn't exist, mainly for the simple reason that different developers would require different tools, e.g. a WinForms developer may not need the same stuff that a Web developer requires.
My main criteria would be a combination of how well do I know how to use it, how well do those around me know how to use it, and how much time do I have to get to learn how to use it.  If all the other developers in my team are using X, then there is a good chance I could learn X and ask them questions when I have them.  Similarly, there may be tools that I learn on my own as I stumble into things talked about over and over again.

I haven't ever thought about this so much formally. Mine includes:

Fast typing.
IDLE for Python. DrScheme for scheme. 
For other code: TextPad on Windows, gedit on linux. I don't like vi or emacs. I just like an editor that I can use shift to highlight things. 
Command line on linux.

Granted, I haven't worked on any large projects recently, so I haven't had the need of anything more powerful yet.
