GUI App with Visual C++ Express Edition

What tool (preferably free) can be used with Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition to create Win32 GUI applications? As you know the Express Edition does not include a GUI resource editor.


It doesn't, but that doesn't stop you from creating a Win32 GUI app; you can still do this in code.
If that's unappealing for you, just do a Google search for "win32 Resource Editor." There are a few available. Any tool that creates .rc files can be compiled into your C++ project.

You can create Win32 GUI applications using the WTL, wxWidgets, or Qt libraries, among others. These have been discussed before in this question on StackOverflow. Note that, as I answered in this question, the Express Edition does not include MFC, so that's not an option for you.
I hope that someone else will be able to recommend a good resource editor.

Somewhat different from your answer, because it cannot be used with Visual C++, but check out wxDevC++....it is like visual studios but has the drag and drop window creation that i think you are looking for.
