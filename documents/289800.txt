Where can I find the Maven installation directory in Eclipse 3.4
java maven-2 eclipse-plugin
I have installed m2eclipse plugin from http://m2eclipse.codehaus.org/. Now I want to use that as a standalone build tool but I am unable to find the installation directory. Can anyone help me in this?


I am not sure to understand what you want.
m2eclipse is a plugin for Eclipse, thus it must be run inside Eclipse.
To have a standalone build tool, I suggest that you just download directly the Maven2 binaries files, and install it on your computer, if it is not already done!
For your information, all plugins are stored in the eclipse-dir/plugins directory, as a subdirectory or as a JAR file.

I have both the plugin (with its embedded maven instance) and a full maven download. Both should end up using the same repository in something like C:\Documents and Settings\user\.m2. 
There are a few cases where you need a full maven download anyways. For example, trying to build a groovy maven plugin crashes with the embedded maven, but works fine for the full download.
You can also specify from the preference pane in Eclipse, to use a differen maven installation than the embedded one. 
Hope this helps.

My Eclipse is using a Default Maven Version (3.0.4). So try this:
Option 1: Restart
Restart your Eclipse and look if the Maven configuration is right again
under "Windows" -> "Preferences" -> "Maven" -> "Installations" 
Option 2: Select/Configure your Embedded "Maven Runtime"
Right-click on your project -> "Run As..." -> under "Maven Build", Tab "Main" -> take the "External" Maven in the Drop-Down Box. Then run it.

You can execute "mvn --version"
It will give you result like : 

       Apache Maven 3.0.5 (r01de14724cdef164cd33c7c8c2fe155faf9602da; 2013-02-19  14:51:28+0100)

The Maven Home will provide where ur maven is installed.
