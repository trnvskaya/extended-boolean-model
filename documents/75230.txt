How do you quickly find the URL for a Win32 API on MSDN?

How do you quickly find the URL for a Win32 API on MSDN?  It's easy for .NET methods -- just add the method name (for example, System.Byte.ToString) to http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/.
However, for Win32 APIs (say GetLongPathName), this doesn't work: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/GetLongPathName.
I want to be able to use the URL in code comments or documentation.  So the URL one gets with an MSDN or Google search (for example, http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa364980.aspx) isn't really what I'm looking for.  I'd really like my code comments to look something like:
// blah blah blah.  See http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/GetLongPathName for more information.
What's the magic pixie dust for Win32 APIs?  Or does it only work for .NET methods?


Google might be your best bet.  I know the msdn site search has time and again pointed me in the wrong direction, but a quick switch to Google ("GetLongPathName site:msdn.microsoft.com") never steers me wrong.

FWIW if you have the MSDN installed locally on your machine the Zeus editor has a feature to search the local copy of the MSDN.
For example, placing the cursor on the GetLongPathName word within a text document and using the Zeus Help, Quick Help, Current Word menu, the following MSDN page gets loaded: 
ms-help://MS.VSCC.v80/MS.MSDN.vAug06.en/fileio/fs/getlongpathname.htm 

I am using Linkify by cough me, which lets you link 
// see msdn:GetLongPathName

to the google search japollock mentions.

You could use MSDN search.  
http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Search/en-US/?Refinement=86&Query=GetLongPathName
Refinement=86 stands for Win32 search.
