With wicket where does hibernate.cfg.xml file go?
hibernate wicket
I'm new to Wicket and Hibernate and can't get past the "org.hibernate.HibernateException: /hibernate.cfg.xml not found" error. I've put that file in every location imagineable but I'm still stuck. Where exactly does that file go and/or am I missing a wicket file config setting somewhere?


If you're just starting with Wicket and Hibernate, you may be interested in the Databinder toolkit.

Ensure hibernate.cfg.xml file placed in classpath.

I'd place the hibernate,cfg.xml in the /WEB-INF folder of your application.

the common form to connect that technologies is with springframework, take  a look http://wicketinaction.com/2009/06/wicketspringhibernate-configuration/
and also springframework help you with  lazy load exception, and transaction management
