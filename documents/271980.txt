Signing a desktop application
desktop
I'd like to know how to have a desktop application signed as a product from my company. I'm not sure of the details.I think the process is I have to purchase a certificate from a company like verisign
Thanks


You need to sign the code with an Authenticode certificate.

Generate and issue the software publisher X.509 certificate.
