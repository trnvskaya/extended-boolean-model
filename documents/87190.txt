.NET library for processing HTML e-mails & stripping previous responses
c# .net html email
Does anyone know of a .NET library that will process HTML e-mails and can be used to trim out the reply-chain?  It needs to be able to accept HTML -or- text mails and then trim out everything but the actual response, removing the trail of messages that are not original content.  I don't expect it to be able to handle responseswhen they're interleaved into the previous mail ("responses in-line") - that case can fail.
We have a home-built one based on SgmlReader and a series of XSL transforms, but it requires constant maintenance to deal with new e-mail clients.  I'd like to find one I can buy... :)
Thanks,
Steve


This does not answer much of your question, but the W3C's Converting HTML to Other Formats has a section on converting HTML to text. I hope it helps someone develop a full answer to your question!

One free and very useful library we've used for dealing with HTML, including malformed HTML, is the HtmlAgilityPack.
There is no StripOutPreviousResponses() function, but it may help you with your home-made one.
