$1 outputting no characters in regex
regex
A couple people just recommended removing the curly brackets from ${1}, but that didn't seem to change anything; still getting nothing for $1.
I am trying to put the stuff within parentheses into the value of a src attribute in an img tag:
$toc_line =~ s!<inlineFig.*?(\.\./pics/ch09_inline99_*?\.jpg)*?</inlineFig>!<img src="$1" alt="" />!g;

The img tags still come out with src="" instead of, eg, src="../pics/ch09_inline99_00".
Thx

I think you want to add dots before the second and third stars.
