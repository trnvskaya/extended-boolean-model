Find out which remote branch a local branch is tracking

How can I find out which remote branch a local branch is tracking?
Do I need to parse git config output, or is there a command that would do this for me?


I use EasyGit (a.k.a. "eg") as a super lightweight wrapper on top of (or along side of) Git.  EasyGit has an "info" subcommand that gives you all kinds of super useful information, including the current branches remote tracking branch.  Here's an example (where the current branch name is "foo"):

pknotz@s883422: (foo) ~/workspace/bd
$ eg info
Total commits:      175
Local repository: .git
Named remote repositories: (name -> location)
  origin -> git://sahp7577/home/pknotz/bd.git
Current branch: foo
  Cryptographic checksum (sha1sum): bd248d1de7d759eb48e8b5ff3bfb3bb0eca4c5bf
  Default pull/push repository: origin
  Default pull/push options:
    branch.foo.remote = origin
    branch.foo.merge = refs/heads/aal_devel_1
  Number of contributors:        3
  Number of files:       28
  Number of directories:       20
  Biggest file size, in bytes: 32473 (pygooglechart-0.2.0/COPYING)
  Commits:       62


I don't know if this counts as parsing the output of git config, but this will determine the URL of the remote that master is tracking:

$ git config remote.$(git config branch.master.remote).url


I've run across this problem as well. I often use multiple remotes in a single repository, and it's easy to forget which one your current branch is tracking against. And sometimes it's handy to know that, such as when you want to look at your local commits via git log remotename/branchname..HEAD.
All this stuff is stored in git config variables, but you don't have to parse the git config output. If you invoke git config followed by the name of a variable, it will just print the value of that variable, no parsing required. With that in mind, here are some commands to get info about your current branch's tracking setup:
LOCAL_BRANCH=`git name-rev --name-only HEAD`
TRACKING_BRANCH=`git config branch.$LOCAL_BRANCH.merge`
TRACKING_REMOTE=`git config branch.$LOCAL_BRANCH.remote`
REMOTE_URL=`git config remote.$TRACKING_REMOTE.url`

In my case, since I'm only interested in finding out the name of my current remote, I do this:
git config branch.`git name-rev --name-only HEAD`.remote


I think git branch -av only tells you what branches you have and which commit they're at, leaving you to infer which remote branches the local branches are tracking.
git remote show origin explicitly tells you which branches are tracking which remote branches.  Here's example output from a repository with a single commit and a remote branch called abranch:
$ git branch -av
* abranch                d875bf4 initial commit
  master                 d875bf4 initial commit
  remotes/origin/HEAD    -> origin/master
  remotes/origin/abranch d875bf4 initial commit
  remotes/origin/master  d875bf4 initial commit

versus
$ git remote show origin
* remote origin
  Fetch URL: /home/ageorge/tmp/d/../exrepo/
  Push  URL: /home/ageorge/tmp/d/../exrepo/
  HEAD branch (remote HEAD is ambiguous, may be one of the following):
    abranch
    master
  Remote branches:
    abranch tracked
    master  tracked
  Local branches configured for 'git pull':
    abranch merges with remote abranch
    master  merges with remote master
  Local refs configured for 'git push':
    abranch pushes to abranch (up to date)
    master  pushes to master  (up to date)


Two choices:
% git rev-parse --abbrev-ref --symbolic-full-name @{u}
origin/mainline

or
% git for-each-ref --format='%(upstream:short)' $(git symbolic-ref -q HEAD)
origin/mainline


I use this alias
git config --global alias.track '!sh -c "
if [ \$# -eq 2 ]
 then
   echo \"Setting tracking for branch \" \$1 \" -> \" \$2;
   git branch --set-upstream \$1 \$2;
 else
   git for-each-ref --format=\"local: %(refname:short) <--sync--> remote: %(upstream:short)\" refs/heads && echo --URLs && git remote -v;
fi  
" -'

then
git track

note that the script can also be used to setup tracking.

Here is a command that gives you the tracking branch:
$ git branch -vv
  main   aaf02f0 [main/master: ahead 25] Some other commit
* master add0a03 [jdsumsion/master] Some commit

You have to wade through the SHA and any long-wrapping commit messages, but it's quick to type and I get the tracking branches aligned vertically in the 3rd column.

You can use git checkout, i.e. "check out the current branch". This is a no-op with a side-effects to show the tracking information, if exists, for the current branch.
$ git checkout 
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.


Another simple way is to use
cat .git/config in a git repo
This will list details for local branches

Following command will remote origin current fork is referring to  

git remote -v  

For adding a remote path,  

git remote add origin path_name  


Another method (thanks osse), if you just want to know whether or not it exists:
if git rev-parse @{u} > /dev/null 2>&1
then
  printf "has an upstream\n"
else
  printf "has no upstream\n"
fi


Yet another way
git status -b --porcelain

This will give you
## BRANCH(...REMOTE)
modified and untracked files


git branch -r -vv

will list all branches including remote.

The local branches and their remotes.
git branch -vv 

All branches and tracking remotes.
git branch -a -vv

See where the local branches are explicitly configured for push and pull.
git remote show {remote_name}


If you are using gradle,
```
def gitHash = new ByteArrayOutputStream()    
project.exec {
                commandLine 'git', 'rev-parse', '--short', 'HEAD'
                standardOutput = gitHash
            }

    def gitBranch = new ByteArrayOutputStream()   
    project.exec {
                    def gitCmd = "git symbolic-ref --short -q HEAD || git branch -rq --contains "+getGitHash()+" | sed -e '2,\$d'  -e 's/\\(.*\\)\\/\\(.*\\)\$/\\2/' || echo 'master'"
                    commandLine "bash", "-c", "${gitCmd}"
                    standardOutput = gitBranch
                }

```
