Vista BEX error
winapi windows-vista
Recently I got IE7 crashed on Vista on jar loading (presumably) with the following error:
Problem signature:

Googling revealed this sort of problems is common for Vista and relates to Java (although SUN negates). Also I think it has something to do with DEP. I failed to find official Microsoft Kb.
So, the questions are:

What BEX stands for?
What is it about?
How to deal with such kind of errors?



BEX=Buffer overflow exception. See http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc738483.aspx for details. However, c000000d is STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER; the technet article talks primarily about status c0000005 or c0000409 (access violation/DEP)

Java and IE7 do not like to play together nicely.  Just turn off DEP, it will work fine then.

Most likely there is an addon that is messing with IE.
You can try this.
1.      Open IE
2.      Switch to the Advanced tab.
3.      Click the Reset Internet Explorer Settings button.
4.      Click Reset to confirm the operation.
5.      Click Close when the resetting process finished.
6.      Uncheck Enable third-party browser extensions option in the Settings box.
7.      Click Apply, click OK.
After this, check to see if it works and if it does, enable one addon at a time until you find the culprit. Then uninstall it and reinstall it if you need it.

just try disabling the bing or msn toolbar - should do the trick.
