how to (simply) generate POST http request from java to do the file upload
java applet http-headers network-protocols
I would like to upload files from java application/applet using POST http event.  I would like to avoid to use any library not included in SE, unless there is no other (feasible) option. 
So far I come up only with very simple solution. 
- Create String (Buffer) and fill it with compatible header (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1867.txt)
- Open connection to server URL.openConnection() and write content of this file to OutputStream. 
I also need to manually convert binary file into POST event. 
I hope there is some better, simpler way to do this?


You need to learn about the chunked encoding used in newer versions of HTTP. The Apache HttpClient library is a good reference implementation to learn from.

You need to use the java.net.URL and java.net.URLConnection classes.
There are some good examples at http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/networking/urls/readingWriting.html
Here's some quick and nasty code:
public void post(String url) throws Exception {
	URL u = new URL(url);
	URLConnection c = u.openConnection();

	c.setDoOutput(true);
	if (c instanceof HttpURLConnection) {
		((HttpURLConnection)c).setRequestMethod("POST");
	}

	OutputStreamWriter out = new OutputStreamWriter(
		c.getOutputStream());

	// output your data here

	out.close();

	BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(
			    new InputStreamReader(
		     		c.getInputStream()));

	String s = null;
	while ((s = in.readLine()) != null) {
		System.out.println(s);
	}
	in.close();
}

Note that you may still need to urlencode() your POST data before writing it to the connection.
