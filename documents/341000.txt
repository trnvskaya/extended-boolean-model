Newbie: Visual Studio 2008 Standard Edition: How do I see more than "Reporting" project type?
visual-studio-2008 projects
I just bought a VS 2008 Standard license upgrade. (I was using the integrated shell for learning F# and express edition for c#. )
I performed the install, re-booted, and when I click file->new->project ... all I get is the choice for "Reporting" project type under C#. IS there a way to expand the number of choices for the various project types?
( I just uninstalled all things visual studio 2008 shell, express, etc... and the install went OK.  )


You can install templates or save your project as a template.
