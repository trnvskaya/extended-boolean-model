What is needed to execute visual studio 2005 web tests?
mstest web-testing
Our test department has a series of web tests created using Visual Studio 2005 Team Tester Edition.
I would like to be able to execute these tests against my local machine. I attempted to use the mstest command line tool to accomplish this as described in this MSDN article. But I get the following error:

C:\WebTests\Participant>mstest
  /testcontainer:AE_ActivityDue_Touch.webtest
  Microsoft (R) Test Execution Command
  Line Tool Version 9.0.30729.1
  Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.
  All rights reserved.
Loading
  AE_ActivityDue_Touch.webtest...
  AE_ActivityDue_Touch.webtest File
  extension specified '.webtest' is not
  a valid test extension.

Any hints on how I can get this to work? Eventually we want to work them into our CI process.


You need VSTS Test Edition. No bueno.
