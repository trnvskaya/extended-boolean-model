Add Custom TextboxCell to a DataGridView control that contains a button to open the FileDialog
.net .net-2.0
I would like to add a DataGridViewTextBoxCell cell to a DataGridViewCell control, but as well as being able to type in the text cell as normal it must also contain a '...' button that once clicks brings up the OpenFileDialog window to allow the user to select a file. Once selected, the text cell will be populated with the full file path.
What is the best way to go about this?
Thanks


This MSDN article explains how to add a custom control to a DataGridView
You should be able to make a UserControl that has a textbox and button on it and embed that in the DataGridView.

You will need to create your own column and cell classes in order to do this. I would suggest using .NET Reflector to look at the implementation details of the DataGridViewTextBox as a starting point and then customizing to add display of a button at the end of it.
