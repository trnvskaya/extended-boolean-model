VistaDB Connection Issue Programmatically using SQLConnection and ConnectionString
connection vistadb
I'm getting an error connecting to a VistaDB using a connection string in the web.config file.
It works fine using a SQLDataSource AFTER I specified the ProviderName. On another page I'm only connecting in code and 
Here is the code for the connection string:
Public Function CreateConnection() As SqlConnection
    _connectionString = ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings("ConnectionString").ToString()
    Return New SqlConnection(_connectionString)
End Function
Here is the error:

A network-related or instance-specific
  error occurred while establishing a
  connection to SQL Server. The server
  was not found or was not accessible.
  Verify that the instance name is
  correct and that SQL Server is
  configured to allow remote
  connections. (provider: SQL Network
  Interfaces, error: 26 - Error Locating
  Server/Instance Specified)

How can I resolve this error?


You can't use a SqlConnection with a VistaDB connection string.  That is the error you are getting from SQL Server - it can't find that server.
Use a VistaDBConnection instead.
