When using Google Chrome, I want to debug some JavaScript code. How can I do that?


Try adding this to your source:
debugger;

It works in most, if not all browsers. Just place it somewhere in your code, and it will act like a breakpoint.

Windows: CTRL-SHIFT-J
Mac: â¥-â-J
Also available through the wrench menu (Tools > JavaScript Console):


Ctrl + Shift + J opens Developer Tools.

In Chrome 8.0.552 on a Mac, you can find this under menu View/Developer/JavaScript Console ... or you can use Alt+CMD+J.

Windows and Linux:
Ctrl + Shift + I keys to open Developer Tools
Ctrl + Shift + J to open Developer Tools and bring focus to the Console.
Ctrl + Shift + C to toggle Inspect Element mode.
Mac:
â¥ + â + I keys to open Developer Tools
â¥ + â + J to open Developer Tools and bring focus to the Console.
â¥ + â + C to toggle Inspect Element mode.

Shift + Control + I opens the Developer tool window. From bottom-left second image (that looks like the following) will open/hide the console for you:


Press the F12 function key in the Chrome browser to launch the JavaScript debugger and then click "Scripts".
Choose the JavaScript file on top and place the breakpoint to the debugger for the JavaScript code.

From the console in Chrome, you can do console.log(data_to_be_displayed).

For Mac users, go to Google Chrome --> menu View --> Developer --> JavaScript Console.


To open the dedicated âConsoleâ panel, either:

Use the keyboard shortcuts


On Windows and Linux: Ctrl + Shift + J
On Mac: Cmd + Option + J

Select the Chrome Menu icon, menu -> More Tools -> JavaScript Console. Or if the Chrome Developer Tools are already open, press the âConsoleâ tab.
