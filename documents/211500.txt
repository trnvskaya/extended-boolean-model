Eclipse, where to change the current debug line background?
eclipse colors
Can anyone point me to the preferences page that has the setting of the DEBUG current line background color? I have changed almost all the colours to dark ones and still get annoyed by this almost white current line indicator while debugging (note that the current line indication in editing mode is OK).


Ok, now I found it myself (through major reverse engineering). It is in General\Editors\Text Editors\Annotations page. It's called "Debug Current Instruction Pointer"

On my version of Eclipse it is 

General\Editors\Text Editors\Annotations\Debug Call Stack"
