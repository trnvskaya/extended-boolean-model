Adding Items Using DataBinding from TreeView to ListBox WPF
wpf data-binding listbox treeview
I want to add the selected item from the TreeView to the ListBox control using DataBinding (If it can work with DataBinding). 
<TreeView HorizontalAlignment="Left" 
          Margin="30,32,0,83" 
          Name="treeView1" 
          Width="133" >

</TreeView>
<ListBox VerticalAlignment="Top" 
         Margin="208,36,93,0" 
         Name="listBox1" 
         Height="196" >       
</ListBox>

TreeView is populated from the code behind page with some dummy data. 


I'm pretty sure it is possible, since WPF is really flexible with data binding, but I haven't done that specific scenario yet.
I've been following a WPF Databinding FAQ from the MSDN blogs as of late and it provides a lot of insights that might help.

You can bind to an element using ElementName, so if you wanted to bind the selected tree item to the ItemsSource of a ListBox:
ItemsSource="{Binding SelectedItem, ElementName=treeView1}"
