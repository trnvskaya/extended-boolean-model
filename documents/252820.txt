Syntax colouring using Swing
java swing
Is it possible to have something like a JTextArea which will color some keywords based on some mappings I have ?


I am not sure, because I believe JTextArea only directly supports a single font in a single color.
According to SyntaxHighlighter Class article, JTextPane is the way to go.

Here are a few other choices that you could try
