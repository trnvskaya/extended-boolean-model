How to handle error logging
php error-logging
Until recently I've been using syslog in my System_Exception exception handler to log important errors - a pretty useful concept I thought. However my host just cut me off, and it appears that loveable syslog has actually been sending my error reports to everyone on the server (it's a shared server). They weren't too pleased.
I've now switched to using a log.txt (and will now have to secure this with chmod or something) - but does anyone have any other suggestions for me to try? This seems a bit rusty.
Oh, and don't use syslog on anything except a dedicated server or somewhere that can handle it ;-)


I like to log minor stuff to a database (if it's possible without slowing things down a lot).  It makes it easier to go back and condense results from the log.
For fatal errors, I try to pipe them into FogBugz using ScoutSubmit

Try log4php. I'm using log4net for my .NET project and it's just terrific. :)

I use log4net.  Great tool.  It can output logs to files, database, emails, UDP, etc.
Personally, I output to files with the rolling File Appender.  It makes reviewing logs very simple.
