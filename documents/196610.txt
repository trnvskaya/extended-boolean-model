Java: Triple Curly Bracing
java coding-style folding
I've been given some code with commenting unlike anything I've come across before:
//{{{ Imports
import imports;
//}}}

It is the same for each method block,  
//{{{ above the code block  
//}}} below the code block

Maybe it's to emphasize a code block?

A quick search for "triple curly" comment suggests it's "Emacs folding mode".
Or some other code folding marker in any case.

jEdit uses {{{ and }}} to mark "explicit" folds.

Actually, Vim uses those triple braces in comments, too.
Tell the one you got the code from, that folding this way is a bad idea. Vim can set fold points at syntactic folding hints, defined in the highlighting file.

It may also be for some code generators. Some generators allow you to edit generated code, and use markers like that so the generator knows where it can regenerate.
