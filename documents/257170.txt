Change journal operations in .NET?
.net windows ntfs
I'm looking for the .NET/C# way of performing Change Journal Operations (without importing unmanaged code).
Any hints or RTFM-links?

You have to download the Source code as there are no official Releases.  I was able to run the demo (on Windows 7), but not able to see which Files were changed.  This library may still be in its infancy.
