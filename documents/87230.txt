How to edit sessions parameters on Oracle 10g XE?
database oracle
default is 49
how to edit to higher?


You will need to issue the following command (connected as a user that has alter system privileges, sys will do it)
alter system set sessions=numberofsessions scope=spfile;
Have you been getting an ORA-12516 or ORA-12520 error?
If so it's probably a good idea to increase the number of processes too
alter system set processes=numberofprocesses scope=spfile;
IIRC you'll need to bounce the database after issuing these commands.
This link http://www.oracle.com/technology/tech/php/pdf/underground-php-oracle-manual.pdf has some good information about configuring XE.
I consulted it when I ran into similar issues using XE.

You can check connection limits in order to fine tune the session/process limits:

Step1: take a look at the processes limition. 
select * from gv$resource_limit;
Step2: increase the parameter from 150 (default) to 300 (or any other desired number)
sql>alter system set processes=300 scope=spfile;
Step3: reboot the database to let parameter taking effect.
ps: check link for more info.
