Does anyone know the language used to code Orkut?
asp.net
For sure this question will not help anyone in a heavy way, but it can be useful somehow. In the beginning, all Orkut pages had the extension *.aspx, but now all pages are masqueraded under a Main#page.aspx.
Sorry if this Main# is an ASP feature, but it does not look like one to me. Does anyone know the language Orkut was coded in? (I meant the language behind the "Main#")


browsing around, it seems like a lot of the stuff ends up as .py (python) files.   From what I remember, Orkut was created, and then bought out by Google, so they may be in the process of switching it over to python, which is a more standard Google Language.
