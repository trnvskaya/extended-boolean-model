Where can documentation be found for the features of GDB, and the debugging process, specific to debugging of Cell Linux programs mixing PPU and SPU code?


One comprehensive overview seems to be here http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redpieces/abstracts/sg247575.html?Open

Documents at the IBM developerWorks site for Cell can be found here:
