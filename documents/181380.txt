Delphi Project Needing runtime Packages, even with runtime Packages off
delphi packages bpl
My Delphi7 project will not run on my clients computer if i don't have a few of the runtime packages in the path. eg rtl70.bpl
I have Build with runtime packages unticked, so shouldn't they be complied into the exe?
Edit: the Project uses Jedi Packages (TJvPlugin) and running the program with out any plugin installed works fine. As Soon as i add a Plugin, the bpl not found errors reappear. Seems like ill have to live with the extra packages. 


You also need to uncheck the "Use Dynamic RTL" on the Linker tab of the Project Options.
Caveat: I'm using C++Builder, but I believe the options are the same.

It has been a while, but it seems like there was something where you needed to (1) check build with runtime packages, and then that enables some other editor (maybe list of packages to use), and you (2) make a change there.  (3) Then do a full build, and then (4) remove the runtime packages check and do another (5) full build.  It is important to do a full build each time.  

From memory:
1. check the build with runtime packages
2. Remove all the run time packages from the list
3. Full build
4. Uncheck the build with run time packages
5. Full build.  
Can't test, don't have D7 anymore...

One may find this obvious, but check the size of the executable once you've compiled, if it's larger, it'll run.  When we manually copy in our updates a smaller dll is a big red flag that something is wrong with the project options. 

Your project may use DLLs or COM objects that have been built with Delphi packages.
