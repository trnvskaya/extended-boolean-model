Best .NET Wrapper for Google Maps or Yahoo Maps?
asp.net maps
I need to do a quick demo app using Google Maps (or Yahoo Maps, or any similar service).  So far I haven't had much luck finding .NET wrappers for any of these services.
Any suggestions or pointers?
I'm not opposed to using the native javascript api to do this, but I assumed someone would have already written a wrapper to easily integrate this into an ASP.NET application.


I always check CodePlex.com
http://www.codeplex.com/googlemap
http://www.codeplex.com/YahooMap
The GoogleMaps project above has a lot of good examples on the project leader's website.

I've had good luck with this one:  http://www.shabdar.org/google-maps-user-control-for-ASP-Net-part1.html (assumes you have the ajax extensions at your disposal - this makes it easy to use but it might not be the best for performance)

I like the virtual earth maps that microsoft produces. For a .net mashup of this go here:

Here are some links but as with most things i have not got round to trying them yet.

If you are interested, there is an ASP.NET Virtual Earth Mapping Server Control here:
http://simplovation.com/page/webmapsve.aspx
This is essentially a "wrapper" around Virtual Earth that abstracts out most (if not all) of the JavaScript that you would traditionally need to write. It allows you to handle map events and manipulate map events completely from server-side .NET code.

I'm the creator of one of the most important GoogleMaps controls for ASP.NET.
You can find it on googlemaps.subgurim.net. It's translated to 15 languages, has more than 25.000 downloads, a very active forum, code gallery, icon gallery, etc.
It's great for novel developers and advanced ones. You can done almost everything that can be done with the javascript API, plus a lot of extra features.
Of course, it has a great documentation.
Try it!
