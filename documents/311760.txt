Viewing swf files in magazine format
view flash magazine
I have a set of swf files and can view them one at a time. However what I would like to is to view them in magazine format, as below:
First view is: swf file1 (magazine front cover)
Next view: swf file2 (magazine page 1) on left + swf file3 (magazine page 2) on right
Next view: swf file4 (magazine page 3) on left + swf file5 (magazine page 4) on right
Next view: swf file6 (magazine page 5) on left + swf file7 (magazine page 6) on right
etc
etc
Last view: swf filex (magazine back cover)
So it's like flipping through a amagzine. This is what one can see on issuu.com
I'd like to get the software that will do this. Preferably free!  


I'm not familiar with issuu.com, but seems like you could very easily accomplish this with basic HTML.  Split your viewing area into two equally-sized side-by-side regions and put a flash object in each one.  If you've got a fairly standard naming convention, you could programmatically determine the files that would go together.  (even always on right, odd on left)
For a given spread, the pages for that spread are
leftpage = (spreadnumber * 2) - 2;

and
rightpage = (spreadnumber * 2) - 1;

So, spread 3 would be pages (3*2)-2 = 4 (left) and (3*2)-1 = 5 (right).

Check out Megazine, it's an open source page flip engine that will do exactly what you need written in AS3, source code is available.
