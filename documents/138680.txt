Vim extension (via Python)?
python vim
is it possible to extend vim functionality via custom extension (preferably, written in Python)?
What I need ideally is custom command when in command mode. E.g.
ESC
:do_this
:do_that


vim supports scripting in python (and in perl as well, I think).
You just have to make sure that the vim distribution you are using has been compiled with python support.
If you are using a Linux system, you can download the source and then compile it with
./configure --enable-pythoninterp 
make
sudo make install

Inside vim, you can type
:version

to list the available features; if it has python support, you should see a '+python' somewhere (a '-python' otherwise).
Then, to check the usage of the python module, you can type
:help python

P.S: if you're going to compile the vim sources, make sure to check the available configure options, you might need to specify --with-python-config-dir as well.
P.P.S: to create a "custom command in command mode" (if I understand correctly what you mean), you can create a function "MyFunction" in a vim script (using python or the vim scripting language) and then invoke it with 
:Call MyFunction()

Check 
:help user-functions

for details

Yes it is. There are several extensions on http://www.vim.org/scripts/index.php 
It can be done with python as well if the support for python is compiled in.

Google is our friend.

Had a problems to compile Vim with Python. 
"...checking if compile and link flags for Python are sane... no: PYTHON DISABLED" in the ./configure output.
On Ubuntu 10.04 you have to install 'python2.6-dev'. The flags for ./configure are:
--enable-pythoninterp
--with-python-config-dir=/usr/lib/python2.6/config
Make sure you got a path to directory, which contains 'config.c' file. Also no '/' at the end of the path! That caused me problems.
