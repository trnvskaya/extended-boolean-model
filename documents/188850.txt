How to launch multiple Internet Explorer windows/tabs from batch file?
internet-explorer batch-file
I would like a batch file to launch two separate programs then have the command line window close. Actually, to clarify, I am launching Internet Explorer with two different URLs.
So far I have something like this:
start "~\iexplore.exe" "url1"
start "~\iexplore.exe" "url2"

What I get is one instance of Internet Explorer with only the second URL loaded. Seems the second is replacing the second. I seem to remember a syntax where I would load a new command line window and pass the command to execute on load, but can't find the reference.
As a second part of the question: what is a good reference URL to keep for the times you need to write a quick batch file?
Edit: I have marked an answer, because it does work. I now have two windows open, one for each URL. (thanks!) The funny thing is that without the /d approach using my original syntax I get different results based on whether I have a pre-existing Internet Explorer instance open. 

If I do I get two new tabs added for
my two URLs (sweet!)  
If not I get only one final tab for the second URL I passed in.



There is a setting in the IE options that controls whether it should open new links in an existing window or in a new window.  I'm not sure if you can control it from the command line but maybe changing this option would be enough for you.
In IE7 it looks like the option is "Reuse windows for launching shortcuts (when tabbed browsing is disabled)".

Try this in your batch file:
@echo off
start /d "C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer" IEXPLORE.EXE www.google.com
start /d "C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer" IEXPLORE.EXE www.yahoo.com


Thanks for the tip Rodger.
For me it worked as below:
@echo off

start /d "" IEXPLORE.EXE www.google.com

start /d "" IEXPLORE.EXE www.yahoo.com

With the settings in Internet Explorer 8:

always open popups in a new tab
a new tab in the current window

This worked for me:
start /d IEXPLORE.EXE www.google.com
start /d IEXPLORE.EXE www.yahoo.com

But for some reason opened them up in Firefox instead?!?
I tried this but it merely opened up sites in two different windows:
start /d "C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer" IEXPLORE.EXE www.google.com
start /d "C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer" IEXPLORE.EXE www.yahoo.com


Try this so you allow enough time for the first process to start.. else it will spawn 2 processes because the first one is not still running when you run the second one...
This can happen if your computer is too fast..
@echo off
start /d iexplore.exe http://google.com
PING 1.1.1.1 -n 1 -w 2000 >NUL
START /d iexplore.exe blablabla

replace blablabla with another address

Thanks Marcelo. This worked for me. I wanted to open a new IE Window and open two tabs in that so I modified the code:
start iexplore.exe website
PING 1.1.1.1 -n 1 -w 2000 >NUL 
START /d iexplore.exe website


You can use either of these two scripts to open the URLs in separate tabs in a (single) new IE window. You can call either of these scripts from within your batch script (or at the command prompt):
JavaScript
Create a file with a name like: "urls.js":  
var navOpenInNewWindow = 0x1;
var navOpenInNewTab = 0x800;
var navOpenInBackgroundTab = 0x1000;

var intLoop = 0;
var intArrUBound = 0;
var navFlags = navOpenInBackgroundTab;
var arrstrUrl = new Array(3);
var objIE;

    intArrUBound = arrstrUrl.length;

    arrstrUrl[0] = "http://bing.com/";
    arrstrUrl[1] = "http://google.com/";
    arrstrUrl[2] = "http://msn.com/";
    arrstrUrl[3] = "http://yahoo.com/";

    objIE = new ActiveXObject("InternetExplorer.Application");
    objIE.Navigate2(arrstrUrl[0]);

    for (intLoop=1;intLoop<=intArrUBound;intLoop++) {

        objIE.Navigate2(arrstrUrl[intLoop], navFlags);

    }

    objIE.Visible = true;
    objIE = null;


VB Script
Create a file with a name like: "urls.vbs":  
Option Explicit

Const navOpenInNewWindow = &h1
Const navOpenInNewTab = &h800
Const navOpenInBackgroundTab = &h1000

Dim intLoop       : intLoop = 0
Dim intArrUBound  : intArrUBound = 0
Dim navFlags      : navFlags = navOpenInBackgroundTab

Dim arrstrUrl(3)
Dim objIE

    intArrUBound = UBound(arrstrUrl)

    arrstrUrl(0) = "http://bing.com/"
    arrstrUrl(1) = "http://google.com/"
    arrstrUrl(2) = "http://msn.com/"
    arrstrUrl(3) = "http://yahoo.com/"

    set objIE = CreateObject("InternetExplorer.Application")
    objIE.Navigate2 arrstrUrl(0)

    For intLoop = 1 to intArrUBound

        objIE.Navigate2 arrstrUrl(intLoop), navFlags

    Next

    objIE.Visible = True
    set objIE = Nothing


Once you decide on "JavaScript" or "VB Script", you have a few choices:
If your URLs are static:  
1) You could write the "JS/VBS" script file (above) and then just call it from a batch script.  
From within the batch script (or command prompt), call the "JS/VBS" script like this:
cscript //nologo urls.vbs
cscript //nologo urls.js


If the URLs change infrequently:
2) You could have the batch script write the "JS/VBS" script on the fly and then call it.  

If the URLs could be different each time:
3) Use the "JS/VBS" scripts (below) and pass the URLs of the pages to open as command line arguments:  
JavaScript
Create a file with a name like: "urls.js":  
var navOpenInNewWindow = 0x1;
var navOpenInNewTab = 0x800;
var navOpenInBackgroundTab = 0x1000;

var intLoop = 0;
var navFlags = navOpenInBackgroundTab;
var objIE;
var intArgsLength = WScript.Arguments.Length;

    if (intArgsLength == 0) {

        WScript.Echo("Missing parameters");
        WScript.Quit(1);

    }

    objIE = new ActiveXObject("InternetExplorer.Application");
    objIE.Navigate2(WScript.Arguments(0));

    for (intLoop=1;intLoop<intArgsLength;intLoop++) {

        objIE.Navigate2(WScript.Arguments(intLoop), navFlags);

    }

    objIE.Visible = true;
    objIE = null;


VB Script
Create a file with a name like: "urls.vbs":
Option Explicit

Const navOpenInNewWindow = &h1
Const navOpenInNewTab = &h800
Const navOpenInBackgroundTab = &h1000

Dim intLoop
Dim navFlags      : navFlags = navOpenInBackgroundTab
Dim objIE

    If WScript.Arguments.Count = 0 Then

        WScript.Echo "Missing parameters"
        WScript.Quit(1)

    End If

    set objIE = CreateObject("InternetExplorer.Application")
    objIE.Navigate2 WScript.Arguments(0)

    For intLoop = 1 to (WScript.Arguments.Count-1)

        objIE.Navigate2 WScript.Arguments(intLoop), navFlags

    Next

    objIE.Visible = True
    set objIE = Nothing


If the script is called without any parameters, these will return %errorlevel%=1, otherwise they will return %errorlevel%=0. No checking is done regarding the "validity" or "availability" of any of the URLs.

From within the batch script (or command prompt), call the "JS/VBS" script like this:
cscript //nologo urls.js "http://bing.com/" "http://google.com/" "http://msn.com/" "http://yahoo.com/"
cscript //nologo urls.vbs "http://bing.com/" "http://google.com/" "http://msn.com/" "http://yahoo.com/"

OR even:
cscript //nologo urls.js "bing.com" "google.com" "msn.com" "yahoo.com"
cscript //nologo urls.vbs "bing.com" "google.com" "msn.com" "yahoo.com"


If for some reason, you wanted to run these with "wscript" instead, remember to use "start /w" so the exit codes (%errorlevel%) will be returned to your batch script:
start /w "" wscript //nologo urls.js "url1" "url2" ...
start /w "" wscript //nologo urls.vbs "url1" "url2" ...


Edit: 21-Sep-2016
There has been a comment that my solution is too complicated. I disagree. You pick the JavaScript solution, or the VB Script solution (not both), and each is only about 10 lines of actual code (less if you eliminate the error checking/reporting), plus a few lines to initialize constants and variables.  
Once you have decided (JS or VB), you write that script one time, and then you call that script from batch, passing the URLs, anytime you want to use it, like:  
cscript //nologo urls.vbs "bing.com" "google.com" "msn.com" "yahoo.com"

The reason I wrote this answer, is because all the other answers, which work for some people, will fail to work for others, depending on:  

The current Internet Explorer settings for "open popups in a new tab", "open in current/new window/tab", etc... Assuming you already have those setting set how you like them for general browsing, most people would find it undesirable to have change those settings back and forth in order to make the script work.
Their behavior is (can be) inconsistent depending on whether or not there was an IE window already open before the "new" links were opened. If there was an IE window (perhaps with many open tabs) already open, then all the new tabs would be added there as well. This might not be desired. 

The solution I provided doesn't have these issues and should behave the same, regardless of any IE Settings or any existing IE Windows. (Please let me know if I'm wrong about this and I'll try to address it.)

Of course it is an old post but just for people how will find it through search engine.
Another solution is to run it like this for IE9 and later
iexplore.exe" -noframemerging http://google.com
iexplore.exe" -noframemerging http://gmail.com

-noframemerging means run IE independently. For example it you want to run 2 browser and login as different username it will not work if you just run 2 IE. but with -noframemerging it will work. -noframemerging works for IE9 and later, for early versions like IE8 it is -nomerge
usually I create 1 but file like this run_ie.bat
"c:\Program Files (x86)\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe" -noframemerging %1

and I create another bat file like this run_2_ie.bat
start run_ie.bat http://google.com
start run_ie.bat http://yahoo.com
