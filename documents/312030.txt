Entity Framework pipeline: Expression trees to ESQL to SQL?
entity-framework
What is the Entity Framework pipeline like?
What gets translated to SQL, Expression Trees or ESQL, or both?
Is ESQL something an Entity Framework provider needs to implement or translate, or that the framework takes care of?


Have you looked at the sample provider source code?

Both Entity SQL and LINQ expressions are parsed into a common cannonical query tree which is then parsed to generate the provider specific SQL.
