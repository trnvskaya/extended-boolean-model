Flex: Why can't I handle certain events?
flex events
In certain cases, I can't seem to get components to receive events.
[edit] 
To clarify, the example code is just for demonstration sake, what I was really asking was if there was a central location that a listener could be added, to which one can reliably dispatch events to and from arbitrary objects.
I ended up using parentApplication to dispatch and receive the event I needed to handle.
[/edit]
If two components have differing parents, or as in the example below, one is a popup, it would seem the event never reaches the listener (See the method "popUp" for the dispatch that doesn't work):
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<mx:Application xmlns:mx="http://www.adobe.com/2006/mxml" 
        layout="absolute" 
        initialize="init()">
<mx:Script>
	<![CDATA[
		import mx.controls.Menu;
		import mx.managers.PopUpManager;

		// Add listeners
		public function init():void
		{
			this.addEventListener("child", handleChild);
			this.addEventListener("stepchild", handleStepchild);
		}

		// Handle the no pop button event
		public function noPop(event:Event):void
		{
			dispatchEvent(new Event("child"));
		}

		// Handle the pop up
		public function popUp(event:Event):void
		{
			var menu:Menu = new Menu();
			var btnMenu:Button = new Button();
			btnMenu.label = "stepchild";
			menu.addChild(btnMenu);
			PopUpManager.addPopUp(menu, this);

			// neither of these work...
			this.callLater(btnMenu.dispatchEvent, [new Event("stepchild", true)]);
			btnMenu.dispatchEvent(new Event("stepchild", true));
		}

		// Event handlers

		public function handleChild(event:Event):void 
		{
			trace("I handled child");
		}

		public function handleStepchild(event:Event):void {
			trace("I handled stepchild");
		}
	]]>
</mx:Script>

<mx:VBox>
	<mx:Button label="NoPop" id="btnNoPop" click="noPop(event)"/>
	<mx:Button label="PopUp" id="btnPop" click="popUp(event)"/>
</mx:VBox>
</mx:Application>

I can think of work-arounds, but it seems like there ought to be some central event bus... 
Am I missing something?


You are attaching the listener to this when the event is getting dispatched from btnMenu.
This should work:

dispatchEvent(new Event("stepchild", true));

ps. There is really no reason to put an unnecessary 'this' everywhere, unless it's explicitly required to overcome scope issues. In this case you can just leave every this out.

Above is correct.
You are dispatching the event from btnMenu, but you are not listening for events on btnMenu - you are listening for events on the Application.
Either dispatch from Application:
dispatchEvent(new Event("stepchild", true));

or listen on the btnMenu
btnMenu.addEventListener("stepchild",handleStepChild);
btnMenu.dispatchEvent(new Event("stepchild",true));
