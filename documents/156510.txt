Increase Stack Size on Windows (GCC)
windows gcc compiler-construction linker stack
Is there a way to increase the stack size of a Windows application at compile/link time with GCC?


You could run editbin after linking.

When creating threads you use the dwStackSize paremater, but I'm not sure how to change the size for the main thread, this indicates its in the exe's header, so it may be an option for the compiler/linker, else you need to find the relevant part of the header and change it yourself.

IIRC, In GCC you can provide the --stack,[bytes] parameter to ld.
E.g.
gcc -Wl,--stack,16777216 -o file.exe file.c

To have a stack of 16MiB, I think that the default size is 8MiB.

There are two stack sizes in Windows. The initially commited size, and the total reserved size. You can set both with a STACKSIZE statement in a .def file.
