What is the key sequence for closing the current buffer in Emacs?
emacs
If I click on File -> Close, it closes the buffer like I want, but doesn't list a key mapping. What is the key mapping?


BKB has already given correct answer. Just wanted to add that C-h b lists the key bindings applicable in current buffer

You can use  C-x k to kill current buffer. See Emacs Manual .

Well, you can view the shortcut of any function with the Help command (C-h).
Press C-hw and then type the command name as you would in M-x mode.

For example (in your case):

Press C-hw
Type the name of the command: kill-buffer ( you can also use tab/space to autocomplete :) )
Press RET


Hope that helps :)

The question asks how to kill the current buffer. Use M-x kill-this-buffer. On my Emacs, it is mapped to s-k. Fewer keystrokes is better!
