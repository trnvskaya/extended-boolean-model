Configuring WordPress .htaccess to view subfolders
wordpress .htaccess
I have a WordPress installation with an .htaccess file that looks like this:
# BEGIN WordPress
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.php [L]
</IfModule>
# END WordPress

I tried installing a fresh copy of WordPress into a subdirectory for a separate blog and am getting 404 errors within the root WordPress when I try to view it. I'm assuming this is because of the .htaccess file. 
How do I change it so that I can view the subfolder?


Edit#2: ok i think i figured this out, but it's pretty messy.
modify your base wordpress install's .htaccess file to look like this:
# BEGIN WordPress
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteBase /
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/blog2/.*
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
  RewriteRule . /index.php [L]
</IfModule>
# END WordPress

now, load a new copy of wordpress into "blog2/", and copy your wp-config.php file over to it. edit the "/blog2/wp-config.php" file and change the $table_prefix to something different than your first blog. (this will install both wordpresses into the same database).
once you've done that, you should be able to go to:
http://yourdomain.com/blog2/

and finish up the installation without issue. the initial problem was that the new copy of wordpress kept trying to use the first copy's wp-config.php file. moving it over manually fixed that all up.
because i'm insane, i tested this with two fresh copies, wrote a few test articles, and was able to navigate around without issue, so it should work :)

For future reference, you may want to try this:
# BEGIN WordPress
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /blog2/
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /blog2/index.php [L]
</IfModule>
# END WordPress
