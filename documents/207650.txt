Any good logging libraries that support .NET compact framework?


log4net actually supports compact framework 1.0, will try it out!

log4net is a good choice, I use it for all projects.

Nlog does too.
There are some functionalities not available in compact network (logging of Exception instances out of the box for example).

NLog also supports .NET Compact Framework. 

Log4net is the best option, but it doesn't have Zip log feature.
