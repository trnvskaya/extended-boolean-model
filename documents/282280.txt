Garbage Collector Flash Player
flash memory-management garbage-collection
Is there a way to force the flash garbage collector to clean up freed memory? I've seen that it takes a lot of time for flash to clean up not referenced memory...


Unfortunately there isn't. It's something Grant Skinner has written lots about, so check his blog.

You can add things to your own garbage collector and then whipe them as they complete.
var antiGC:Dictionary = new Dictionary(false);

var loaderwidth:Tween = new Tween(maskbox, "width", Regular.easeIn, 1, 1000, 25, false);


antiGC[loaderwidth] = loaderwidth;

loaderwidth.addEventListener(TweenEvent.MOTION_FINISH, lwfinished);

function lwfinished(e:TweenEvent){

    loaderwidth.removeEventListener(TweenEvent.MOTION_FINISH, lwfinished);
    antiGC[e.currentTarget] = null;
    delete antiGC[e.currentTarget];
}
