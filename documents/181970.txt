Processing Linux SIGnals using Gambas
linux signals gambas
I would like to send a (as yet undetermined) SIGnal from a bash script to a Gambas program when a specific file has been changed. 
How can I get my Gambas program to process this SIGnal?


If the documentation is anything to go by, this doesn't seem possible. However, I would suggest asking the same question on the Gambas mailing list (and/or link to this question on Stack Overflow). Please report back if you get an answer via the mailing list.

According to http://www.mail-archive.com/gambas-user@lists.sourceforge.net/msg01890.html and http://www.nabble.com/Question-about-signal-management-inside-gambas-console-program---td20626972.html, it is not yet possible.
