Installing Curl IDE/RTE on AMD processors
ide amd-processor curl-language
Trying to move my development environment to Linux. And new to Curl. Can't get it to install the IDE & RTE packages on an AMD HP PC running Ubuntu x64. I tried to install the Debian package via the package installer and get "Error: Wrong architecture - i386". Tried using the  --force-architecture switch but it errors out. 
I'm assuming Curl IDE will just run under Intel processors? Anyone have any luck with this issue and can advise?


It's been a while since I ran linux, but try looking for the x64 version. There are also x64 to x86 compatibility libraries available that should make 32 bit programs work for most situations. 
The ubuntu forums are a much better place for this question, however.
