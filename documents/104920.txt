.net performance interop pinvoke analysis
Is there a .NET performance counter to show the rate of p/invoke calls made?  I've just noticed that the application I'm debugging was making a call into native code from managed land within a tight loop.  The intended implementation was for a p/invoke call to be made once and then cached.  I'm wondering if I could have noticed this mistake via a CLR Interop or Remoting .NET performance counter.  Any ideas?


Try the ".NET CLR Interop" for "# of marshalling" performance counter.
