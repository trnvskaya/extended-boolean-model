Resizable Java component
java resize components
I would like to have a Java component which has a resize icon on the bottom right of the component so that when I drag that icon, the component will automatically resize with it.
By resize icon, I mean the following:

The above image contains the resize icon in the Google Talk messenger's main window. Is there any Java component which provides this facility?


You will find in this article how to add an icon looking like the resize icon you are referring to.

the JStatusBar ?

ummm
putting an image there is not hard... the resizing is. you'll want to use (once you have some sort of button) code like this:
private void buttonMousePressed(java.awt.event.MouseEvent evt) {
        sx = evt.getX();
        sy = evt.getY();
}

private void buttonMouseDragged(java.awt.event.MouseEvent evt) {
        if(!evt.isMetaDown()){
                Point p = getLocation();

                locX = p.x + evt.getX()-sx;
                locY = p.y + evt.getY()-sy;
                setLocation(locX, locY);
        }
}

...except instead of Setlocation you'll want to use something like setBounds or setSize... and you'll have to modify the code a bit. What I have is for dragging it, but the principle is the same.
