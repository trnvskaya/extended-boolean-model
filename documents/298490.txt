Host a WPF control in activex instead of Win32 App
wpf activex
I'm searching an example of an activex that contain a WPF control.
I'm able to see the control during registration of activex in the test activex container but when I instantiate it i cannot see WPF but what is coded inside OnDraw.
Any hint or example?


check out the msdn article on Hosting Windows Presentation Foundation Content in a Win32 Application (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms744829.aspx)

Acording to "WPF 4 Unleashed":
FAQ: What about the reverse directionâexposing WPF controls as ActiveX controls?
There is no built-in support for this above and beyond HWND interoperability, so your best bet is to use your favorite means of creating a non-WPF ActiveX control (using Active Template Library [ATL], for example) and inject WPF content inside it.
