Windows 2008 concurrent TCPIP connections
networking tcp windows-server-2008
In Windows XP, Microsoft took the decision to limit the number of half open connections in later service packs. Patching tcpip.sys was rumoured to fix this. Does such a limit exist in Windows 2008, and if so, is it configurable?


When Vista SP1 shipped, there was some article about the alignment with Windows Server 2008, and their example was the networking subsystem, and they said something like that it is designed to handle thousands of connections. So I guess, no, they won't limit it to 10 :)
I think it was this article (scroll to bottom), though I think I remember it being longer.
