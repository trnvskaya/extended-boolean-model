How to control the capitalization of month and day names returned by DateFormat?
java date internationalization
Here is a quick test program:
    public static void main( String[] args )
{
    Date date = Calendar.getInstance().getTime();

    System.out.println("Months:");
    printDate( "MMMM", "en", date );
    printDate( "MMMM", "es", date );
    printDate( "MMMM", "fr", date );
    printDate( "MMMM", "de", date );

    System.out.println("Days:");
    printDate( "EEEE", "en", date );
    printDate( "EEEE", "es", date );
    printDate( "EEEE", "fr", date );
    printDate( "EEEE", "de", date );

}

public static void printDate( String format, String locale, Date date )
{
    System.out.println( locale + ": " + (new SimpleDateFormat( format, new Locale( locale ) )).format( date ) );
}

The output is:

Months:
en: September
es: septiembre
fr: septembre
de: September
Days:
en: Monday
es: lunes
fr: lundi
de: Montag
How can I control the capitalization of the names. For some reason the Spanish and French always seem to return names that start with a lowercase letter.


You may not want to change the capitalization -- different cultures capitalize different words (for example, in German you capitalize every noun, not just proper nouns).

Not all languages share english capitalization rules. I guess you'd need to alter the data used by the API, but your non-english clients might not appreciate it...

Capitalisation rules are different for different languages.  In French, month names should not be capitalised.

I'm having a problem now where a sentence begins with "dimanche 07 mars", which wouldn't matter if it were not at the beginning of a sentence. I guess this cannot be changed, unless I do manual string manipulation on the first character of the string.
