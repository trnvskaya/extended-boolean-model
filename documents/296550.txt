using date range in Lucene.net
lucene lucene.net
I understand how Lucene.net can work for text indexing. Will I be able to efficiently search for documents based on a given date range? Or will Lucene.net just use text matching to match the dates?


Lucene.Net will just use text matching, so you'd need to format the dates correctly before adding to the index:
    public static string Serialize(DateTime dateTime)
    {
        return dateTime.ToString("yyyyMMddHHmmss", CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);
    }

    public static DateTime Deserialize(string str)
    {
        return DateTime.ParseExact(str, "yyyyMMddHHmmss", CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);
    }

You can then, for example, perform a range based query to filter by date (e.g. 2006* to 2007* to include all dates in 2006 and 2007).

I went in to trouble when i converted date in to yyyymmddHHmmssff. When i tried sorting the data, it gave me an exception that too big to convert..something. Hence i search and found then you need to have two columns. one in yyyymmdd and the other HHmmss, and then use Sort[] and give these two columns and then use. This will solve the issue.
