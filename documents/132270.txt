fatal error C1900: Il mismatch between 'P1' version '20060201' and 'P2' version '20050411'
linker
I compile my project with VIsual Studio 2005 Express Edition, and get this linking error. Can anyone suggest how to solve that?

Try re-installing.  It appears to be an install of the wrong service pack.

MSDN: Fatal Error C1900 says:
"Tools run in various passes of the compiler do not match. number1 and number2 refer to the dates on the files. For example, in pass 1, the compiler front end runs (c1.dll) and in pass 2, the compiler back end runs (c2.dll). The dates on the files must match and if they do not, reinstall and use the current version of each tool."
Go to Add/Remove Programs, select Visual Studio 2005 Express Edition, click Change/Remove, then perform a repair.

I downloaded VS2005 Service Pack 1 from Microsoft, installed it and it fixed the problem.
