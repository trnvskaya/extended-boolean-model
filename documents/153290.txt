Has anyone used lucene.net with Linq-to-Entities?
linq-to-entities lucene lucene.net
If anyone has done this, please let me know. I don't know anything about lucene.net. I have never used it, but I heard about it. I was wondering how something like that would integrate with the Linq entity framework?


Check out Linq to Lucene project.
