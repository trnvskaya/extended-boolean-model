Custom namespace for code behind .aspx page
.net .net-2.0 namespaces
I am using .NET2.0. Let's say a have a simple aspx form with txtInput and btnSomeAction
   <asp:TextBox ID="txtInput" runat="server"></asp:TextBox>
   <asp:Button ID="btnSomeAction" runat="server" CommandName="SomeAction" Text="Do"/>

Then within the code behind the form I have
Protected Sub btnSomeAction_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles btnSomeAction.Click
    Dim s As String
    s = txtInput.Text
End Sub

It all works fine.
Then I want to add the code to a custom namespace like
Namespace mycustomnamespace

When doing that I would get a complier error:
Name 'txtInput' is not declared  - as if the code was no longer connected to the page
Do i need to modify the aspx page to include the namespace?, What about the partial class?

Yes.  At the top of your aspx file you should see something like 

<%@ Page AutoEventWireup="false" Inherits="Blah.Foo.Bar" %>


Where bar is the name of the class in the codebehind and Blah.Foo is it's namespace.  You would need to change it to

<%@ Page AutoEventWireup="false" Inherits="mycustomnamespace.Bar" %>
