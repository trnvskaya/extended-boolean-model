C# controls in a MFC Application
c# .net c++ user-interface interop
I am responsible for the User Interface of an application written completely in Visual C++  using MFC and some third-part controls. I would like to use C# (WinForms or even better WPF) to improve the application look&feel.
I would like some advices about how to do it. Links, articles, examples...
Right now the user interface is isolated in a single project and I don't want to compile the whole module with CLR. So how do I have to manage that from the architectural point of view?
I have already looked at the Internet for the subject and read MSDN information. I would like more detailed information...is it convinient? pros/cons? have you used this approach successfully in a "big" application?
I don't want to compile the whole ui project with CLR...can I just have all the .NET code in a isolated project and call it from the ui project? what's the best way to do it?
Thanks in advance.


A good starting point is the Win32 and WPF interop page on MSDN.

I found this codeproject article gave a good introduction to the subject of mixing mfc / winforms code.

When faced with the same problem, I made an ActiveX control in C# and used it in my MFC app.  The folks at MS took out support for building ActiveX controls with .NET, but it's still possible to do so with a plain Jane COM class which has a custom [ComRegisterFunction()] and [ComUnregisterFunction].
Although MS would like to tell us that the /clr flag will solve our problems, it measurably slowed down my large MFC app.
