How can I read raw (CF_HTML) clipboard data in a webpage or C#?
drag-and-drop clipboard copy-paste
If I drag and drop a selection of a webpage from Firefox to HTML-Kit, HTML-Kit asks me whether I want to paste as text or HTML. If I select "text," I get this:
Version:0.9
StartHTML:00000147
EndHTML:00000516
StartFragment:00000181
EndFragment:00000480

According to MSDN, this is "CF_HTML" formatted clipboard data. Is it the same on OS X and Linux systems? 
Is there any way to access this kind of detailed information (as opposed to just the plain clip fragment) in a webpage-to-webpage drag and drop operation? What about to a C# WinForms desktop application?


It is Microsoft specific, don't expect to see the same information in other OSes.
Note that you get the same format when you copy a fragment from IE.
I am not sure what you mean by "webpage-to-webpage drag and drop operation". To drop where? A textarea?
I don't know C#, but in C/C++ applications, you have to use OpenClipboard and related Win32 APIs to get this info. In particular, GetClipboardData(CF_HTML) allows you to get this info (can be obtained in plain text too, for example, or Unicode data, etc.).

A WinForms app can use Clipboard.GetText to get it. I don't think there is a way to do it in a webpage, however.
