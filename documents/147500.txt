Is it possible to include one CSS file in another?


Yes:
@import url("base.css");

Note:

The @import rule must precede all other rules (except the @charset rule); and
Additional @import statements require additional server requests.

Aggregate CSS into one file to avoid multiple HTTP requests. That is, copy the contents of base.css and special.css into base-special.css and reference only base-special.css).
In 2008, not all browsers supported @import (see Browser Compatibility).

The CSS @import rule does just that. E.g.,
@import url('/css/common.css');
@import url('/css/colors.css');


In some cases it is possible using @import "file.css", and most modern browsers should support this, older browsers such as NN4, will go slightly nuts. 
Note: the import statement must precede all other declarations in the file, and test it on all your target browsers before using it in production.

Yes, use @import 
detailed info easily googled for, a good one at http://webdesign.about.com/od/beginningcss/f/css_import_link.htm

Yes.
@import "your.css";

The rule is documented here.

Yes. Importing CSS file into another CSS file is possible. 
It must be the first rule in the style sheet using the @import rule.
@import "mystyle.css";
@import url("mystyle.css");

The only caveat is that older web browsers will not support it. In fact, this is one of the CSS 'hack' to hide CSS styles from older browsers.
Refer to this list for browser support. 

The @import url("base.css"); works fine but bear in mind that every @import statement is a new request to the server. This might not be a problem for you, but when optimal performance is required you should avoid the @import. 

@import("/path-to-your-styles.css"); 
That is the best way to include a css stylesheet within a css stylesheet using css.

yes it is possible using @import and providing the path of css file
e.g.
@import url("mycssfile.css");

or  
@import "mycssfile.css";


I stumbled upon this and I just wanted to say PLEASE DON'T USE @IMPORT IN CSS!!!! The import statement is sent to the client and the client does another request. If you want to divide your CSS between various files use Less. In Less the import statement happens on the server and the output is cached and does not create a performance penalty by forcing the client to make another connection. Sass is also an option another not one I have explored. Frankly, if you are not using Less or Sass then you should start. http://willseitz-code.blogspot.com/2013/01/using-less-to-manage-css-files.html

sing the CSS @import Rule
here
@import url('/css/header.css') screen;
@import url('/css/content.css') screen;
@import url('/css/sidebar.css') screen;
@import url('/css/print.css') print;


The "@import" rule could calls in multiple styles files. These files are called by the browser or User Agent when needed e.g. HTML tags call the CSS.

<style type="text/css">
@import url("main.css");
</style>

CSS File "main.css" Contains The Following Syntax:
@import url("fineprint.css") print;
@import url("bluish.css") projection, tv;
@import 'custom.css';
@import url("chrome://communicator/skin/");
@import "common.css" screen, projection;
@import url('landscape.css') screen and (orientation:landscape);

To insert in style element use createTexNode don't use innerHTML but:
<script>
var style = document.createElement('style');
style.setAttribute("type", "text/css");
var textNode = document.createTextNode("
    @import 'fineprint.css' print;
    @import 'bluish.css' projection, tv;
    @import 'custom.css';
    @import 'chrome://communicator/skin/';
    @import 'common.css' screen, projection;
    @import 'landscape.css' screen and (orientation:landscape);
");
style.appendChild(textNode);
</script>
