Is there a maximum number of characters that can be written using a StreamWriter?

Is there a maximum number of characters that can be written to a file using a StreamWriter? Or is there a maximum number of characters that WriteLine() can output? I am trying to write some data to a file but all of the data does not seem to make it. This is the current state of my code:
StreamWriter sw = new StreamWriter(pathToFile);

foreach (GridViewRow record in gv_Records.Rows)
{
    string recordInfo = "recordInformation";

    sw.WriteLine(recordInfo);
}



Are you calling StreamWriter.Close() or Flush()?

Be sure you wrap your StreamWriter in a using-block, or are careful about your explicit management of the resource's lifetime.
using (StreamWriter writer = new StreamWriter(@"somefile.txt"))
{
    // ...
    writer.WriteLine(largeAmountsOfData);
    // ...
}


Make sure that you are calling .Flush()
