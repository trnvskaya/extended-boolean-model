How to make 'pretty urls' work in php hosted in IIS?
php iis
Is there some way I can use urls like:

instead of
http://www.blog.com/?p=122
in a windows hosted PHP server?


This is how I did it with WordPress on IIS 6.0

However it all depends on what version of IIS you are using.  If you are lucky enough to use IIS 7.0 you don't really have to worry about pretty urls because everything is supported out of the box.  However if you are using IIS 6.0 you are going to have to use a rewriter and some rules to force the IISness out of IIS.

Isapi Rewrite Filter on CodePlex - actively developed, free ("DonationWare"), open source.

We use the free version of ISAPI_Rewrite.  It uses similar syntax to mod_rewrite, so if you're familiar with that you may have an easier time getting started.
There used to be a (syntax-compatible) port of mod_rewrite for IIS, but I can't find it now.

Use the official IIS URL Rewrite
