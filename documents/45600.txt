A issue with the jquery dialog when using the themeroller css
javascript jquery user-interface dialog
The demos for the jquery ui dialog all use the "flora" theme. I wanted a customized theme, so I used the themeroller to generate a css file. When I used it, everything seemed to be working fine, but later I found that I can't control any input element contained in the dialog (i.e, can't type into a text field, can't check checkboxes). Further investigation revealed that this happens if I set the dialog attribute "modal" to true. This doesn't happen when I use the flora theme. 
Here is the js file:
topMenu = {
    init: function(){
        $("#my_button").bind("click", function(){
            $("#SERVICE03_DLG").dialog("open");
            $("#something").focus();
        });

        $("#SERVICE03_DLG").dialog({ 
            autoOpen: false,
            modal: true, 
            resizable: false,
            title: "my title",
            overlay: { 
                opacity: 0.5, 
                background: "black" 
            }, 
            buttons: { 
                "OK": function() { 
                    alert("hi!");
                }, 
                "cancel": function() { 
                    $(this).dialog("close"); 
                } 
            },
            close: function(){
                $("#something").val("");
            }
        });
    }
}

$(document).ready(topMenu.init);

Here is the html that uses the flora theme:
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">

<head>

Here is the html that uses the downloaded themeroller theme:

As you can see, only the referenced css file and class names are different.
Anybody have a clue as to what could be wrong?
@David: I tried it, and it doesn't seem to work (neither on FF or IE). I tried inline css:
style="z-index:5000"

and I've also tried it referencing an external css file:
#SERVICE03_DLG{z-index:5000;}

But neither of these work. Am I missing something in what you suggested?
Edit:
Solve by brostbeef!
Since I was originally using flora, I had mistakenly assumed that I have to specify a class attribute. Turns out, this is only true when you actually use the flora theme (as in the samples). If you use the customized theme, specifying a class attribute causes that strange behaviour.


After playing with this in Firebug, if you add a z-index attribute greater than 1004 to your default div, id of "SERVICE03_DLG", then it will work. I'd give it something extremely high, like 5000, just to be sure.
I'm not sure what it is in the themeroller CSS that causes this. They've probably changed or neglected the position attribute of the target div that it turns into a dialog.

Man, this is a good one.  I've tried doing a bunch of things on these two pages.  Have you tried just leaving the CSS out altogether and trying both pages then?  I used Firebug to remove the CSS from the header on both pages, and the input still worked on one and not on the other - but, I'm inclined to believe that Firebug doesn't completely remove the CSS from the rendering, and you'll get different results if you actually remove it from the code.
I also found that you can paste text into the text box using the mouse - it just won't accept keyboard input.  There doesn't seem to be any event handler on it that would interfere with this, though.

I tried implementing a themeroller theme with a dialog and tabs and it turns out that the themeroller CSS doesn't work with official jQuery! Especially for dialog and tabs, they modified the element classes from the official jquery ones. See here:

A user's comment:

3) the generated theme that I
  downloaded seems to be incomplete -
  when I attempt to use it my tabs
  (which work with the flora theme, code
  identical to the documentation
  example) do not get styled as tabs
Having run into 3 I thought I was
  stuck and would have to revert using
  âflora"â¦ I have since discovered by
  reading the source code of the âdemoâ
  file that if I adjust my html and give
  the < li> items Iâm using for my tabs
  the âui-tabs-nav-itemâ class then it
  will work.
The theme generated by themeroller is
  thus unfortunately incomplete.  If the
  tabs stuff is incomplete, it makes me
  wonder what else is incomplete.  It
  was rather frustrating.  :(

followed by the themeroller developers comment:

3) Weâll take a look at that. Youâre right that those classes
  should be added by the plugin. For now though, it probably
  wouldnât hurt much to just add them to your markup so you 
  can use themeroller themes.
  Weâll check it out, though. I think our selectors could be 
  based off of the parent ui-tabs selector instead, but I think 
  we were trying not to use elements in our  selectors. Consider
  it on the to-do list


I think it is because you have the classes different.
<div id="SERVICE03_DLG" class="flora">  (flora)
<div id="SERVICE03_DLG" class="ui-dialog"> (custom)
Even with the flora theme, you would still use the ui-dialog class to define it as a dialog.
I've done modals before and I've never even defined a class in the tag.  jQueryUI should take care of that for you.
Try getting rid of the class attribute or using the "ui-dialog" class.
