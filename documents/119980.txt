Detect via javascript whether Silverlight is installed
javascript silverlight
Is there a javascript function I can use to detect whether a specific silverlight version is installed in the current browser?
I'm particularly interested in the Silverlight 2 Beta 2 version. I don't want to use the default method of having an image behind the silverlight control which is just shown if the Silverlight plugin doesn't load.
Edit: From link provided in accepted answer:
Include Silverlight.js (from Silverlight SDK)
Silverlight.isInstalled("2.0");



Include Silverlight.js (from Silverlight SDK)
Silverlight.isInstalled("4.0")

Resource:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc265155(vs.95).aspx

var hasSilverlight = Boolean(window.Silverlight);

var hasSilverlight2 = hasSilverlight && Silverlight.isInstalled('2.0');

Etc....

Please actually use the latest script available at http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/silverlightjs for the latest updates.  This has several fixes in it.

Download this script: http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/silverlightjs
And then you can use it like so:


if (Silverlight.isInstalled)
{
alert ("Congrats. Your web browser is enabled with Silverlight Runtime");
}



        if (Silverlight.isInstalled("1.0")) {
            try {
                alert("Silverlight Version 1.0 or above is installed");
            }
            catch (err) {
                alert(err.Description);
            }
        }
        else {
            alert("No Silverlight is installed");
        }

from this video.
Silverlight.isInstalled is always true so version string such as "1.0" must be provided to make it useful.
