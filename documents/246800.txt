ASP.NET Menu Parent Menu Item Highlighting on Hover when Flyouts are enabled
asp.net javascript css menu hover
I have a ASP.Net Menu Control with three levels and flyouts enabled.
I want to highlight the parent items (right upto the top level parent) whenever a user hovers over the menu items.
I do not want to use a client side solution as described here:
http://www.codeproject.com/KB/webforms/AspMenuParentHighlighting.aspx
Is there an elegant server side solution?
Kind regards.


The only server side solution I can think of would be to set the client side solution on page load. 
Is there a reason that you would want to build this server side rather than client side? Because forcing an event like this to occur server side is, by definition, rather inelegant.
