Visual Designer errors, when there are no errors
visual-studio custom-controls designer
I get errors when viewing forms and there are not any.  I can close VS and reopen and it is fine.  What cases this?  Can it be fixed without closing?


Verify none of your custom user controls has any code errors.
Also try starting up Visual Studios using devenv /resetskippkgs from the command prompt.
It will reset packages if there is an error in loading.
