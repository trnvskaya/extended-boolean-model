.NET 2.0 - Tokenizing space separated text
.net .net-2.0 text-parsing
Suppose you have output like this:
Word1           Word2   Word3      Word4

Where the number of spaces between words is arbitrary. I want to break it into an array of words.
I used the following code:
string[] tokens =
         new List<String>(input.Split(' '))
             .FindAll
             (
                 delegate(string token)
                 {
                      return token != String.Empty;
                 }
             ).ToArray();

Not exactly efficient, but does the job nicely.
How would you do it?


I would use a regex for the split with "\w+" for the pattern.

He already mentions string.Split().  What he's missing is StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries:
string[] tokens = input.Split(new char[] { ' ' },
    StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries);
