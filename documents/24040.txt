Is there a site for detailed unit testing samples?
unit-testing testing
Is there a site for unit testing as RefactorMyCode for refactoring? I think it would be a great help for beginners like me.


So far, from what I have seen, RMC seems to be one-of-a-kind, which is both cool, but sad :(
It seems pretty inactive, but I have posted a couple of questions on there, and amazed at the response (a lot of people just have the RSS feed and wait for something to happen). So I would definately recommend just getting active on there..
However, I have read some great books on Safari including MS Press' "Test Driven Development" which I found really helped . However I have to admit, I still need a lot of work in adjusting my brain for TDD etc.
Following this question though! (+1) look forward to seeing if there is more out there! :)
Edit:
Just found this blog post that outlines a number of good bits of software, websites and books :) I knew I had one somewhere!

Check out Google's Testing blog: http://googletesting.blogspot.com/
Lots of interesting articles on testing code.

As for a practical example of how TDD/unit-testing can be applied, I really liked the 
TDD - Practical Guide by David Astels book. While it's focussed on Java, and uses an older version of JUnit and EasyMock in the example code, it gave me a really good idea on how to use unit testing/TDD on an actual project.
