How can I map a list of strings to my entity using NHibernate?
nhibernate
I've got two tables in my database: Articles and Tags
The Tags tables consist of ArticleID (foreign key) and a Tag (varchar).
Now I need to map an articles tags into a readonly collection on Article entity, either using IList Tags or ReadOnlyCollection Tags.
I've consulted the NHibernate reference material, but I can't seem to figure when to use Set, Bag and the other Nhibernate collections. I've seen examples using the ISet collection, but I really don't like to tie my entity classes to a NHibernate type.
How can I do the mapping in NHibernate?
Thank you in advance.
edit: I ended up using a <bag> instead, as it doesn't require an index:
<bag name="Tags" table="Tag" access="nosetter.camelcase" lazy="false">
  <key column="ArticleId" />
  <element column="Tag" type="System.String" />
</bag>



The type of collection to use in your mapping depends on how you want to represent the collection in code. The settings map like so:

The <list> maps directly to an
IList.
The <map> maps directly to an IDictionary.
The <bag> maps to an IList. A  does not completely comply
with the IList interface because the
Add() method is not guaranteed to
return the correct index. An object
can be added to a <bag> without
initializing the IList. Make sure to
either hide the IList from the
consumers of your API or make it
well documented.
The <set> maps to an Iesi.Collections.ISet. That
interface is part of the
Iesi.Collections assembly
distributed with NHibernate.

so if you want an IList to be returned, then you would use the <list> mapping. In your case, I'd probably map using the <list> mapping.
