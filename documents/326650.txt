Vertically align text within input field of fixed-height without display: table or padding?
css xhtml
The line-height property usually takes care of vertical alignment, but not with inputs. Is there a way to automatically center text without playing around with padding?


I've not tried this myself, but try setting:
height : 36px; //for other browsers
line-height: 36px; // for IE

Where 36px is the height of your input.

In Opera 9.62, Mozilla 3.0.4, Safari 3.2 (for Windows) it helps, if you put some text or at least a whitespace within the same line as the input field.
<div style="line-height: 60px; height: 60px; border: 1px solid black;">
    <input type="text" value="foo" />&nbsp;
</div>

(imagine an &nbsp after the input-statement)
IE 7 ignores every CSS hack I tried.
I would recommend using padding for IE only. Should make it easier for you to position it correctly if it only has to work within one specific browser.

I ran into this problem myself.  I found that not specifying an input height, but using the font-height and padding combined, results in vertically aligned text.
For instance, lets say you want to have a 42px tall input box, with a font-size of 20px.  You could simply find the difference between the input height and the font-size, divide it by two, and set your padding to that amount.  In this case, you would have 22px total worth of padding, which is 11px on each side.
<input type="text" style="padding: 11px 0px 11px 0px; font-size: 20px;" />

That would give you a 42px tall input box with perfect vertical alignment.
Hope that helps.

After much searching and frustration a combo of setting height, line height and no padding worked for me when using a fixed height (24px) background image for a text input field.
.form-text {
    color: white;
    outline: none;
    background-image: url(input_text.png);
    border-width: 0px;
    padding: 0px 10px 0px 10px;
    margin: 0px;
    width: 274px;
    height: 24px;
    line-height: 24px;
    vertical-align: middle;
}


Just don't set the height of the input box, only set the font-size, that will be ok

In my opinion, the answer on this page with the most votes is the best answer, but his math was wrong and I couldn't comment on it.
I needed a text input box to be exactly 40 pixels high including a 1 pixel border all the way around.  Of course I wanted the text vertically aligned in the center in all browsers.
1 pixel border top
1 pixel border bottom
8 pixel top padding
8 pixel bottom padding
22 pixel font size
1 + 1 + 8 + 8 + 22 = 40 pixels exactly.
One thing to remember is that you must remove your css height property or those pixels will get added to your total above.
<input type="text" style="padding-top:8px; padding-bottom:8px; margin: 0; border: solid 1px #000000; font-size:22px;" />

This is working in Firefox, Chrome, IE 8, and Safari.  I can only assume that if something simple like this is working in IE8, it should work similarly in 6, 7, and 9 but I have not tested it. Please let me know and I'll edit this post accordingly.

You need to set the vertical align like so:
Vertical-Align: Middle;


I know I'm late to the party but hopefully this'll help anyone looking for a concise answer that does work across all major browsers (except IE6, we have decided to stop supporting that browser so I refuse to even look at it anymore).
    #search #searchbox {
    height: 21px;
    line-height: 21px;
}

This is how I do it.
<ul>
   <li>First group of text here.</li>
   <li><input type="" value="" /></li>
</ul>

then inside your CSS file,  
ul li {
  display: block;
  float: left;
}

That should work for you.

Try :
height: 21px;
line-height: 21px; /* FOR IE */

Because on some versions of IE (< 9) the property height is not properly interpreted.

Go for line-height.
The vertical-align tag works fine for the submit button but not for the text in the input field.
Setting line-height to the height of the input field works on all browsers. Incl IE7.

input[type=text]
{
   height: 15px; 
   line-height: 15px;
}

this is correct way to set vertical-middle position.

Sorry in advance the simple answer...
Just remove your title text and use the input placeholder for your label's title. Some visual and css work after that and your form will be looking tight and user friendly. I'm aware of the disadvantages but this will completely relieve the alignment wrestling.  
I'm actually building one now that includes multi-step and css progress bar in WordPress...based off the ever popular Contact Form 7 plugin and it looks great. Let me know if you want a screenshot.

this example can resolve your problems forever:
add this to the input css property and never add % instead of px:
height:25px;


Late to the party, but the current answers won't work if you have box-sizing: border-box set (which a lot of people do for form elements these days).
Just reset the box sizing for IE8 to box-sizing: content-box; then use one of the padding / height answer.
