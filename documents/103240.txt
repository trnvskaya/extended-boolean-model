Finding First Row in a RDLC Table
asp.net asp.net-2.0 rdlc
I have a table in a RDLC report which is utilized as a subreport, and the first column of this table is a static string. Does anyone know how I can determine if a row is the first in the table.  I tried using "=First("My String")" but it didn't work.


Aggregate functions work with "Scope', referring to the paragraph scope in this MSDN article, might help...

From what I understand you may have to define a scope or try =First("MyString", Nothing).

Looking at the link supplied by ThatBloke in his answer, I found the RowNumber command. 
Which means that this worked:
=IIf(RowNumber(Nothing)=1,"myString", "")


=IIF((RowNumber(Nothing) Mod <>)=0)
<> Indicate No of Rows Which you want To Display
