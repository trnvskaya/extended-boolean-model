In MVC, when do you use <%= %> and <% %>?

In asp.net mvc, when do we use:
<%=  %>
and
<% %>
Do we ever need to put a ; (colon) ?


<%= %> renders the output (string) of the contained command to the response.  <% %> wraps executable statements (logic) in the view to control what gets executed.  You don't use semicolons in the <%= %> blocks, but may in the <% %> depending on what statements are included.
String rendering:
<%= Html.Encode( Model. Property ) %>
Code block:
<% Html.RenderPartial( "ViewName" ); %>
EDIT: Here's a link to the reference.

<%="something" %> is just a shortcut for Response.Write("something")

<%= %> is used when you are calling some HtmlHelper method which returns a string e.g.:
<%= Html.ActionLink("Home", "Index", "Home") %>

<% %> is used when you are calling some HtmlHelper method which is void:
<% Html.RenderPartial("Login"); %>
