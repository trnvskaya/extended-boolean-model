How to debug ORA-01775: looping chain of synonyms?
sql oracle synonym
I'm familiar with the issue behind ORA-01775: looping chain of synonyms, but is there any trick to debugging it, or do I just have to "create or replace" my way out of it?  
Is there a way to query the schema or whatever to find out what the current definition of a public synonym is?  
Even more awesome would be a graphical tool, but at this point, anything would be helpful.


The data dictionary table DBA_SYNONYMS has information about all the synonyms in a database.  So you can run the query
SELECT table_owner, table_name, db_link
  FROM dba_synonyms 
 WHERE owner        = 'PUBLIC'
   AND synonym_name = <<synonym name>>

to see what the public synonym currently points at.

http://ora-01775.ora-code.com/ suggests:
ORA-01775:  looping chain of synonyms
Cause:    Through a series of CREATE synonym statements, a synonym was defined that referred to itself. For example, the following definitions are circular:
CREATE SYNONYM s1 for s2 CREATE SYNONYM s2 for s3 CREATE SYNONYM s3 for s1
Action:   Change one synonym definition so that it applies to a base table or view and retry the operation.

As it turns out, the problem wasn't actually a looping chain of synonyms, but the fact that the synonym was pointing to a view that did not exist.
Oracle apparently errors out as a looping chain in this condition.

I had a similar problem, which turned out to be caused by missing double quotes off the table and schema name.

Today I got this error, and after debugging I figured out that the actual tables were misssing, which I was referring using synonyms. So I suggest - first check that whether the tables exists!! :-))

ORA-01775: looping chain of synonyms
I faced the above error while I was trying to compile a Package which was using an object for which synonym was created however underlying object was not available.

We had the same ORA-01775 error but in our case, the schema user was missing some 'grant select' on a couple of the public synonyms.

If you are using TOAD, go to View>Toad Options>Oracle>General and remove TOAD_PLAN_TABLE from EXPLAIN PLAN section and put PLAN_TABLE

Step 1) See what Objects exist with the name:
select * from all_objects where object_name = upper('&object_name');

It could be that a Synonym exists but no Table?

Step 2) If that's not the problem, investigate the Synonym:
select * from all_synonyms where synonym_name = upper('&synonym_name');

It could be that an underlying Table or View to that Synonym is missing?

Try this select to find the problematic synonyms, it lists all synonyms that are pointing to an object that does not exist (tables,views,sequences,packages, procedures, functions)
SELECT *
FROM dba_synonyms
WHERE table_owner = 'SYSADM'
    AND (
        NOT EXISTS (
            SELECT *
            FROM dba_tables
            WHERE dba_synonyms.table_name = dba_tables.TABLE_NAME
            )
        AND NOT EXISTS (
            SELECT *
            FROM dba_views
            WHERE dba_synonyms.table_name = dba_views.VIEW_NAME
            )
        AND NOT EXISTS (
            SELECT *
            FROM dba_sequences
            WHERE dba_synonyms.table_name = dba_sequences.sequence_NAME
            )
        AND NOT EXISTS (
            SELECT *
            FROM dba_dependencies
            WHERE type IN (
                    'PACKAGE'
                    ,'PROCEDURE'
                    ,'FUNCTION'
                    )
                AND dba_synonyms.table_name = dba_dependencies.NAME
            )
        )


If you are compiling a PROCEDURE, possibly this is referring to a table or view that does not exist as it is created in the same PROCEDURE. In this case the solution is to make the query declared as String eg v_query: = 'insert into table select * from table2 and then execute immediate on v_query;
This is because the compiler does not yet recognize the object and therefore does not find the reference. Greetings.

The less intuitive solution to this error code seems to be problems with the objects that the synonym is pointing to.
Here is my SQL for finding synonyms that point to erroneous objects.
SELECT S.OWNER as SYN_OWNER, S.SYNONYM_NAME as SYN_NAME,
    S.TABLE_OWNER as OBJ_OWNER, S.TABLE_NAME as OBJ_NAME,
    CASE WHEN O.OWNER is null THEN 'MISSING' ELSE O.STATUS END as OBJ_STATUS
FROM DBA_SYNONYMS S
    LEFT JOIN DBA_OBJECTS O ON S.TABLE_OWNER = O.OWNER AND S.TABLE_NAME = O.OBJECT_NAME
WHERE O.OWNER is null
    OR O.STATUS != 'VALID';


A developer accidentally wrote code that generated and ran the following SQL statement CREATE OR REPLACE PUBLIC SYNONYM "DUAL" FOR "DUAL"; which caused select * from dba_synonyms where table_name = 'DUAL';
 to return PUBLIC DUAL    SOME_USER   DUAL rather than PUBLIC   DUAL    SYS DUAL.
We were able to fix it (thanks to How to recreate public synonym "DUAL"?) by running
ALTER SYSTEM SET "_SYSTEM_TRIG_ENABLED"=FALSE SCOPE=MEMORY;
CREATE OR REPLACE PUBLIC SYNONYM DUAL FOR SYS.DUAL;
ALTER SYSTEM SET "_SYSTEM_TRIG_ENABLED"=true SCOPE=MEMORY;


We encountered this error today. 
This is how we debugged and fixed it.

Package went to invalid state due to this error ORA-01775.
With the error line number , We went thru the package body code and found the code which was trying to insert data into a table.
We ran below queries to check if the above table and synonym exists.
SELECT * FROM DBA_TABLES WHERE TABLE_NAME = '&TABLE_NAME';  -- No rows returned

SELECT * FROM DBA_SYNONYMS WHERE SYNONYM_NAME = '&SYNONYM_NAME'; -- 1 row returned

With this we concluded that the table needs to be re- created. As the synonym was pointing to a table that did not exist.
DBA team re-created the table and this fixed the issue.


I'm using the following sql to find entries in all_synonyms where there is no corresponding object for the object_name (in user_objects):
 select * 
   from all_synonyms 
   where table_owner = 'SCOTT' 
     and synonym_name not like '%/%'
     and table_name not in (
       select object_name from user_objects
         where object_type in (
           'TABLE', 'VIEW', 'PACKAGE', 'SEQUENCE',
           'PROCEDURE', 'FUNCTION', 'TYPE'
         )
    );
