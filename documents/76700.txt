What's a simple method to dump pipe input to a file? (Linux)
linux pipe exim
I'm looking for a little shell script that will take anything piped into it, and dump it to a file.. for email debugging purposes. Any ideas?


Use Procmail. Procmail is your friend. Procmail is made for this sort of thing.

The unix command tee does this.
man tee


cat > FILENAME


The standard unix tool tee can do this. It copies input to output, while also logging it to a file.

You're not alone in needing something similar.. in fact, someone wanted i decades ago and developed tee :-)
Of course, you can redirect stdout directly to a file in any shell using the > character:
echo "hello, world!" > the-file.txt


Huh? I guess, I don't get the question?
Can't you just end your pipe into a >> ~file
For example
echo "Foobar" >> /home/mo/dumpfile

will append Foobar to the dumpfile (and create dumpfile if necessary). No need for a shell script... Is that what you were looking for?

If you want to analyze it in the script:
while /bin/true; do
    read LINE
    echo $LINE > $OUTPUT
done

But you can simply use cat. If cat gets something on the stdin, it will echo it to the stdout, so you'll have to pipe it to cat >$OUTPUT. These will do the same. The second works for binary data also.

if you don't care about outputting the result
cat - > filename

or
cat > filename


If you want a shell script, try this:
#!/bin/sh
exec cat >/path/to/file


If exim or sendmail is what's writing into the pipe, then procmail is a good answer because it'll give you file locking/serialization and you can put it all in the same file.
If you just want to write into a file, then
  - tee > /tmp/log.$$
or
  - cat > /tmp/log.$$
might be good enough.

<< command >> | tee < file >>
This will also show the output.
