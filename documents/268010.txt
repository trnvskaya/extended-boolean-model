java decompiling
Is there anyway to decompile java webstart application? 


Start the application, then fetch the JAR(s) from the webstart cache. Proceed to decompile like with any other Java application.

Yes, there is. A Java Webstart application is just one form of deployment. The result is a bunch of jars copied to the users home directory. And these can of course be decompiled for example with jad.

Just rename the files with a .jar extension :)
