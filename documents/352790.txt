With XSLT/XPath, how can I match any element in the null namespace?
xml xslt xpath
<xsl:template match="foo">

matches the foo element in the null namespace.
<xsl:template match="*">

matches any element in any namespace.
I tried:
xmlns:null=""
...
<xsl:template match="null:*">

but it's illegal to declare a prefix for the null namespace.
So how can I match an element with any name in the null namespace?


You could try:
<xsl:template match='*[namespace-uri() = ""]'>

If the node-set is empty or has no namespace URI, an empty string is returned by the namespace-uri function, which should achieve what you want.

ffpf is correct.
For even more clarity I would recommend to use the following match pattern:
 '*[not(namespace-uri() )]'
