Image loading icon for flash/flex?
flex flash loading
You often see those little 'petal' animations while an image or .swf file is loading in a Flash / Flex application.
Do I have to steal this from someone or is there a standard one available from somewhere. i would think there is somethin standard because everyones looks the same!
Ideally I want a flex Image control that displays such an icon when it is loading for more than 1/4 second.


You can download that and other icons (as animated gifs) at AjaxLoad.

Use the aforementioned AjaxLoad.info and load the animated GIF into Flash CS3.  Save as SWF.

Here are a few "loading" SWF files you can use.
