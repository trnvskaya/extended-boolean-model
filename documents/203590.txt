Include directory in VS 2003
visual-studio include
Where is the setting in Visual Studio 2003 to set the include path for individual projects?  I know about the VC Directories option in Tools>Options but that is machine specific and won't help when I hand this off to other developers.  




Strangely I don't see that option.  I ended up opening the vcproj file in jedit and writing it in.
