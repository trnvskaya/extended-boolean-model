What is the best way to store a large amount of text in a table in SQL server?
Is varchar(max) reliable?


In SQL 2005 and higher, VARCHAR(MAX) is indeed the preferred method. The TEXT type is still available, but primarily for backward compatibility with SQL 2000 and lower.

I like using VARCHAR(MAX) (or actually NVARCHAR) because it works like a standard VARCHAR field. Since it's introduction, I use it rather than TEXT fields whenever possible.

In a BLOB 
BLOBs are very large variable binary or character data, typically documents (.txt, .doc) and pictures (.jpeg, .gif, .bmp), which can be stored in a database. In SQL Server, BLOBs can be text, ntext, or image data type, you can use the text type
text 
Variable-length non-Unicode data, stored in the code page of the server, with a maximum length of 231 - 1 (2,147,483,647) characters.

According to the text found here, varbinary(max) is the way to go.  You'll be able to store approximately 2GB of data.

Varchar(max) is available only in SQL 2005 or later. This will store up to 2GB and can be treated as a regular varchar. Before SQL 2005, use the "text" type.

Split the text into chunks that your database can actually handle.  And, put the split up text in another table.  Use the id from the text_chunk table as text_chunk_id in your original table.  You might want another column in your table to keep text that fits within your largest text data type.
CREATE TABLE text_chunk (
     id NUMBER,
     chunk_sequence NUMBER,
     text BIGTEXT)
