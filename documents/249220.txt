What is the best .net Micro Framework dev board, for under $300?
.net embedded robotics .net-micro-framework
I'm looking for a relativity cheap .net Micro Framework development board for use on a personal robotics project. I'd don't need much for I/O, but I want at least one serial port and one Ethernet port. 
I would prefer not to have to spend more than $300 on the board, but if there is an obvious reason to get a better one I'm flexible. 
Currently I'm looking at this device from SJJ Embedded Micro Solutions. Has anyone had experience with this device?


I have not had experience with the SJJ Embedded board but I might just have to give it a shot.
I'm working on a robotics project as a hobby and I'm currently prototyping with Lego Mindstorms and the Robotics SDK from Microsoft.  I had planned on swapping to an Arduino which uses a C-like programming language and weighs in at around $30 assembled.

Here are two different boards that I have been researching. Both of these are around $100.00
 and are meant for the hobbyist. Neither of these boards has ethernet on the board, but is relatively easy to add by adding an external ethernet module
MeridianP
USBizi
USBizi TCP/IP and Ethernet support

This looks very cool. And only 30$.

And this Plus version with ethernet.

FEZ has some now generics for sale from 29.00 USD +shipping.
Starting from a 74Mhz ARM devboard with Arduino compatible connectors + a lot more IO.

It has open source firmware and fully supports the .net micro framework as well as JTAG connector to use for everything else.
Supports runtime debugging (breakpoints, variable inspection, stepping, etc.)
Use Visual C# 2010 Express Edition for development.
Supports networking with Ethernet shield.

On the same site there is a more complex devboard - FEZ Cobra -  which has onboard ethernet connector for ~150 USD.

Soon, the Microsoft Gadgeteer will be produced.

Here is a Channel9 video that shows you how to use VS2010 to create an embedded application. It is due to release in Spring of 2011...

You should look into the GHI family of boards/devices. They start at $24.95 for the FEZ Panda and goes all the way to $399 for the ChipworkX development kit

They are also the first out with Gadgeteer  HW
