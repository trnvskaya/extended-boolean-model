T4 Template directory missing on build server
.net build t4
I've just set up a new build server with the Windows 2008 .NET 3.5 SDK, and for some reason it hasn't installed c:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\TextTemplating so I can't run t4 templates on it. I had a look at the install options in add/remove programs and every single option is checked. 
Any ideas why it is missing? Any ideas how to get it back?


My understanding is that the T4 engine is a feature of Visual Studio, not the .NET Framework SDK. 

The T4 templating engine comes with Visual Studio 2005 SDK or natively with any installation of Visual Studio 2008. I didn't try the express editions to see if the T4 is present but I strongly recommend that you give it a try.
You can download Visual Studio 2008 Express right here.

T4 is only installed with Visual Studio, not the .Net SDK.
However, as of Visual Studio 2010 SP1, you'll find that all the pieces necessary to set up a build server are licensed to be manually copied to your build machine.
See the file buildserver.txt in your VS install directory.
