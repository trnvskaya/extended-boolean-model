Is it possible to deploy an already built Drupal site?
deployment drupal
I'm a Drupal newbie. Is it possible to set up everything and deploy Drupal on the server? I mean things like putting in the content, setting up the modules, etc..., then you put it all up to the production server?


Ofcourse.  

copy all the files
edit the database credentials (sites/default/settings.php)
export the database content via mysqldump or phpMyAdmin (supposing you use MySQL)
import the database content at the target server

I've done it a several times.
