Can you create collapsible #Region like scopes in C++ within VS 2008?

I miss it so much (used it a lot in C#). can you do it in C++?


Yes, you can. See here.
#pragma region Region_Name
//Your content.
#pragma endregion Region_Name


The Visual assist add-in for VC supports regions for c++. Don't know if 2008 has build in regions for C++ though. 

For the VBers:
#Region "identifier_string" 
' Your content
#End Region
