Similar thing to RJS (used in Ruby on Rails) in the Java web app world?
java ruby-on-rails
In Ruby on Rails, there's RJS templates that help do AJAX by returning javascript code that will be executed in the client browser. How can I do a similar thing in the Java/J2EE world? Is Google Widget Toolkit similar to RJS? What options do I have? 


Yes, I think Google Web Toolkit is the java equivalent to RJS templates.

There is no direct equivalent. GWT is great if you want to do all or most of the client side in java. Also worth checking out is DWR, which gives you remote procedure call style access to your server code.
