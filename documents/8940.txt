VMWare Server Under Linux Secondary NIC connection
linux vmware sysadmin nic
With VMWare Server running under Linux (Debain), I would like to have the following setup:

1st: NIC being used by many of the
images running under VMWare, as well
as being used by the Linux OS 
2nd: NIC being used by only 1 image and to be unused by the Linux OS (as its part of a DMZ)

Although the second NIC won't be used by Linux, it is certainly recognised as a NIC (e.g. eth1).
Is this possible under VMWare Server, and if so, is it as simple as not binding eth1 under Linux and then bridging it to the image under VMWare Server?


I believe you can set the desired solution up by rerunning the vmware configuration script.  And doing a custom network setup, so that both NIC's are mapped to your vmware instance.  I would recommend making eth0 the 2nd NIC since it will be easier for Linux to use by default.  Then make eth1 the 1st NIC.
