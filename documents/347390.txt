Visual Studio 2008 C++ Problems
visual-studio-2008 linker
I'm trying to write a program to calculate the quadratic formula.  When I run it, I get 2 error messages:
error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol _WinMain@16 referenced in function ___tmainCRTStartup
fatal error LNK1120: 1 unresolved externals
this is after I changed the last line of code from 
...:
<< danswer1, danswer2 >>
to 
<< danswer1 << "," << danswer2 <<
Before I made that change I got 2 compiler errors: C2563 and C2568.
On a friend's computer the program worked perfectly.
What can I do to fix this?


Is your project a Win32 Console Application or a Win32 Application? If you are using regular main(int argc, char** argv), then make sure your app is a console app.

You can change to a console app by going to the Project Properties, Configuration Properties, Linker, System editor. You can then switch your SubSystem from Windows to Console (or vice-versa). Make sure to do this for both your Debug and Release configurations.
