How to find recent sql update operations acting upon a certain table (SQL Server 2005)
sql sql-server-2005
say I want to find the latest added rows (UPDATE by any user, not necessarily the one which is executing UPDATE)  in XX table.


Please refer to SQL Docs & look for OUTPUT clause (that you can use with UPDATE/INSERT to get the affected records).

You would need to use a Transaction Log reader tool. There are several free ones available as well as commercial offerings.

ApexSQL Log 

You could also try this undocumented command:
 DBCC LOG(<database name>[,{0|1|2|3|4}]).

If you're using SQL Server 2000, RedGate have a free tool called SQL Log Rescue.
EDIT:  Documentation for DBC LOG: 
(1) (2)

SQL Server Profiler will allow you to track hits to the database in real time.  You can set filters on a number of properties to ge the output you need.
