Can I extract a file from a jar that is 3 directories deep?
java jar
I have a jar file that has a file named "client.ts" in (when viewing in ZipGenius) "/com/something/messaging". When I do 
JarFile jarFile = new JarFile("Client.jar");
JarEntry zipFile = jarFile.getJarEntry("client.ts");

It can't find the "client.ts" file. If I package the file in "/resources/" instead it can find it. Does JarFile.getEntry() only drill down one directory? The javadoc for getJarEntry() simply says: Returns the ZipEntry for the given entry name or null if not found.


The full path of the entry within the JAR should work:
JarEntry zipFile = jarFile.getJarEntry("com/something/messaging/client.ts");
