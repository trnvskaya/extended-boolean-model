Tunneling proxy on VS 2008
sql-server database visual-studio-2008 proxy tunnel
Is there a way to tunnel a proxy to access a remote sql server database on visual studio 2008?
I'm working in a project at college that uses a sql server database but the access is restricted to the internal network. I'd like to access the database from my home too.
Thanks in advance.


You can setup a VPN easily...
Take a look to Hamachi and Rebombo, very easy 0 configuration vpn...

If the colledge has VPN set up, you can set up the VPN on your computer to access the database from home.

In the event VPN access is not granted and the highly unlikely event that the SQL Server is exposed through the firewall, could you not get a copy of (or subset of) the database for development on local machine?

You can try this vpn service,it works really well
