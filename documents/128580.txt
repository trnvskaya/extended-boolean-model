Parsing XML with namespaces using jQuery $().find
javascript jquery xml namespaces
I'm trying to get the contents of a XML document element, but the element has a colon in it's name.
This line works for every element but the ones with a colon in the name:
$(this).find("geo:lat").text();

I assume that the colon needs escaping. How do I fix this?


Use a backslash, which itself should be escaped so JavaScript doesn't eat it:
$(this).find("geo\\:lat").text();


That isn't just an ordinary element name.  That's a qualified name, meaning that it is a name that specifically refers to an element type within a namespace.  The element type name is 'lat', and the namespace prefix is 'geo'.
Right now, jQuery can't deal with namespaces very well, see bug 155 for details.
Right now, as a workaround, you should be able to select these elements with just the local name:
$(this).find("lat").text();

If you have to distinguish between element types with the same local name, then you can use filter():
var NS = "http://example.com/whatever-the-namespace-is-for-geo";
$(this).find("lat").filter(function() { return this.namespaceURI == NS; }).text();

Edit: my mistake, I was under the impression that patch had already landed.  Use Adam's suggestion for the selector, and filter() if you need the namespacing too:
var NS = "http://example.com/whatever-the-namespace-is-for-geo";
$(this).find("geo\\:lat").filter(function() { return this.namespaceURI == NS; }).text();


if you have a jquery selector problem with chrome or webkit not selecting it try 
$(this).find('[nodeName=geo:lat]').text();

this way it works in all browsers
