Expose Java class as SOAP WebService - how?
java web-services soap
I am looking for a framework to turn given Java class into WebService (may be with some limitations on method parameters etc)
Thanks


The de-facto standard for this is Apache Axis: http://ws.apache.org/axis/ and http://ws.apache.org/axis2/

You can use axis2, or xfire.  I'm sure there are other ways also, but these are the two that I've used.
