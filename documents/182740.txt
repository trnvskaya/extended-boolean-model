How to unit test the windows workflows?


MS dropped the ball on making workflows easily mockable and testable.  If you want to do thorough tests on your custom activities you'll need to purchase a mocking framework that can mock sealed types such as TypeMock.  Otherwise, you'll have to write your code around the limitations of Workflow.

K. Scott Allen has posted this, which provides an approach to unit testing custom activities (although he says that he is not satisfied). A similar approach is presented by Ron Jacobs here and here.
Another approach is presented by Maurice here and here (he uses TypeMock as Will already mentioned).

Microsoft.Activities.UnitTesting.
A library of helper classes and activities designed to make unit testing of workflows easier.
Looks like there's a Channel 9 video for it on the downloads page, too.
