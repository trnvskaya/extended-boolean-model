ASP conditional error
asp-classic
i am trying to use an ASP conditional here:
if (Request.Cookies("username")) and
(Request.Cookies("password")) <> ""
Then

And i keep getting this error:

Type mismatch: '[string: ""]'

Any ideas what I am getting that?


try
if (Request.Cookies("username") <> "") and (Request.Cookies("password") <> "") Then


Actually, I would do the following..
if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(Request.Cookies("username")) &&
    !string.IsNullOrEmpty(Request.Cookies("password")))
{
    // Do your stuff, here :)
}

Get into the habit of using string.IsNullOrEmpty for testing variables and string.Empty for setting values, if u don't want a string to be null.
