How to avoid screen flickering when showing form with user drawn controls?
c# .net winforms user-controls onpaint
So the transparent background problem is solved.  Now, every time I show the form (or have to have it repainted), I get a lot of flickering.  Is there any way I can not update the screen until the paint event is complete, or any other way to stop the 1/2 second of flickering and flashing while all the objects are being painted?
ANSWER: Double buffering is the way to go.  I was already double buffering on the control, but it has to be set on the form.  I though double buffering only worked when you were subclassing OnPaint yourself.  


Did you try setting the DoubleBuffered property for the form?

Set the DoubleBuffered Property on the form.

Double Buffering might help, another thing you might want to try is:
SuspendLayout();
dostuffhere...
ResumeLayout();
