Recommended notes/doc service that offers an API?
api
I'm looking for a good online service for notes/documents (think Google Docs) that has a decent web UI and offers an API for clients to read/write the stored data.
Google Docs is almost perfect - except there's no way to update the contents of existing documents.


None of the APIs for the more 'Word' like online editors seem to have any 'edit' functionality, just download and upload. This is obviously due to the complexity of the documents being stored.
With Google Docs API you can get a document, edit it, and then re-upload it (you may need to delete the previous version as well I think). Zoho seems to provide an 'update' method which combines the two operations.
Have you looked at the Google Notebook API instead? This might provide more granular access to the data in the 'note' due to its structured approach to storing the data.
