Accessing calendar entries on the iPhone/iPod touch
iphone cocoa-touch
is it possible to access calendar entries on the iPhone/iPod touch, i.e. reading, creating, changing, deleting appointments?
I searched the iPhone SDK documentation but didn't find anything. Perhaps I missed something.


Currently this functionality is not supported by the SDK. If you need this, please consider filing a bug report with Apple.
