How to get WCF statistics from inside an application that uses it?
.net wcf performance networking monitoring
Is it possible to gather performance statistics programmatically from inside a WCF application? For example, the number of connections open or requests received.


Look into WCF Performance Counters. You can query performance counters using the respective  .NET Framework Classes.
Also, you could enable WMI for your WCF Services and query this information from inside your application.
Probably depends on the kind of information you need to get.
