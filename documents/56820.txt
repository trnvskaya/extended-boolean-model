round() in Python doesn't seem to be rounding properly
python floating-point
The documentation for the round() function states that you pass it a number, and the positions past the decimal to round. Thus it should do this:
n = 5.59
round(n, 1) # 5.6

But, in actuality, good old floating point weirdness creeps in and you get:
5.5999999999999996

For the purposes of UI, I need to display 5.6. I poked around the Internet and found some documentation that this is dependent on my implementation of Python. Unfortunately, this occurs on both my Windows dev machine and each Linux server I've tried. See here also.
Short of creating my own round library, is there any way around this?


What about:
round(n,1)+epsilon


can't help the way it's stored, but at least formatting works correctly: 
'%.1f' % round(n, 1) # gives you '5.6'


You can switch the data type to a integer:
>>> n = 5.59
>>> int(n * 10) / 10.0
5.5
>>> int(n * 10 + 0.5) 
56

And then display the number by inserting the locale's decimal separator.
However, Jimmy's answer is better.

You can use the string format operator %, similar to sprintf.
mystring = "%.2f" % 5.5999


You get '5.6' if you do str(round(n, 1)) instead of just round(n, 1).

Floating point math is vulnerable to slight, but annoying, precision inaccuracies.  If you can work with integer or fixed point, you will be guaranteed precision.

printf the sucker.
print '%.1f' % 5.59  # returns 5.6


Formatting works correctly even without having to round:
"%.1f" % n


round(5.59, 1) is working fine. The problem is that 5.6 cannot be represented exactly in binary floating point.
>>> 5.6
5.5999999999999996
>>>

As Vinko says, you can use string formatting to do rounding for display.
Python has a module for decimal arithmetic if you need that.

Take a look at the Decimal module

Decimal âis based on a floating-point
  model which was designed with people
  in mind, and necessarily has a
  paramount guiding principle â
  computers must provide an arithmetic
  that works in the same way as the
  arithmetic that people learn at
  school.â â excerpt from the decimal
  arithmetic specification.

and 

Decimal numbers can be represented
  exactly. In contrast, numbers like 1.1
  and 2.2 do not have an exact
  representations in binary floating
  point. End users typically would not
  expect 1.1 +  2.2 to display as
  3.3000000000000003  as it does with binary floating point.

Decimal provides the kind of operations that make it easy to write apps that require floating point operations and also need to present those results in a human readable format, e.g., accounting.

If you use the Decimal module you can approximate without the use of the 'round' function.  Here is what I've been using for rounding especially when writing monetary applications: 
Decimal(str(16.2)).quantize(Decimal('.01'), rounding=ROUND_UP)

This will return a Decimal Number which is 16.20.  

It's a big problem indeed. Try out this code:
print "%.2f" % (round((2*4.4+3*5.6+3*4.4)/8,2),)

It displays 4.85. Then you do: 
print "Media = %.1f" % (round((2*4.4+3*5.6+3*4.4)/8,1),)

and it shows 4.8. Do you calculations by hand the exact answer is 4.85, but if you try: 
print "Media = %.20f" % (round((2*4.4+3*5.6+3*4.4)/8,20),)

you can see the truth: the float point is stored as the nearest finite sum of fractions whose denominators are powers of two.

Works Perfect 
format(5.59, '.1f') # to display
float(format(5.59, '.1f')) #to round
