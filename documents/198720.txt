ColdFusion web.xml?
java-ee coldfusion
Is there a ColdFusion analog for the deployment descriptor/web.xml file found in a J2EE web container? I know CF is running on top of JRun and that I could just tweak the JRun dd, but what about an application-specific configuration file? Is there something like this that I'm not aware of or do you just have to roll your own?


ColdFusion 8 has several application-specific configurations that can be set in the application.cfc file
application.cfc also implements several "general events" which occur during application execution.  

You might check this posting on Application.cfc http://www.bennadel.com/blog/726-ColdFusion-Application-cfc-Tutorial-And-Application-cfc-Reference.htm.
And if you are not using a version of Coldfusion that has Application.cfc available you will need to look into Application.cfm which is implemented quite a bit differently then Application.cfc.

there is a jrun.xml file that allows for some configuration. It is available in CF7 and CF8. I have only done small tweaks to this file e.g. bind ip address to CF instance. 

ColdFusion provides client and server deployment descriptor files located in \ColdFusion8\wwwroot\WEB-INF. The files are client-config.wsdd and server-config.wsdd respectfully

There are several areas that equivalent settings

application.cfc or on older sites application.cfm

CFAdmin tool has some more settings for Datasources, JVM, etc

Depending on the framework you use, there may be additional .xml configuration files.

Fusebox uses: files called fusebox.xml and circuit.xml

FW/1 uses additional settings in application.cfc
