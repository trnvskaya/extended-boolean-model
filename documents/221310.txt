What code highlighting libs are there for Ruby?
ruby syntax-highlighting ramaze codehighlighter
What'd also interest me is which have more or less dependencies.


Google is our friend...
First hit: http://syntax.rubyforge.org/chapter-1.html#s1

I'm using Coderay (see it in action at the bottom of this article)
Not sure how many (if any) dependencies it has.

See also the Ultraviolet library.

Ultraviolet is a syntax highlighting engine based on Textpow. Since it uses Textmate syntax files, it offers out of the box syntax highlighting for more than 50 languages and 20 themes. 
Ultraviolet is at the same time a stand-alone command line utility and a Ruby library.
