How can I create an editable dropdownlist in HTML?
html combobox html-select
I'd like to create a text field with a dropdown list that lets the user choose some predefined values. The user should also be able to type a new value or select a predefined one from a dropdown list. I know that I can use two widgets for that but in my app it would be more ergonomnic if it was unified in a one widget.
Is there a standard widget or do I have to use a third party javascript?
How about browser portability?


I am not sure there is a way to do it automatically without javascript. 
What you need is something which runs on the browser side to submit your form back to the server when they user makes a selection - hence, javascript.
Also, ensure you have an alternate means (i.e. a submit button) for those who have javascript turned off.
A good example: Combo-Box Viewer
I had even a more sophisticated combo-box yesterday, with this dhtmlxCombo , using ajax to retrieve pertinent values amongst large quantity of data.

The <select> tag only allows the use of predefined entries. The typical solution to your problem is to have one entry labeled 'Other' and a disabled edit field (<input type="text"). Add some JavaScript to enable the edit field only when 'Other' is selected.
It may be possible to somehow create a dropdown that allows direct editing, but IMO that is not worth the effort. If it was, Amazon, Google or Microsoft would be doing it ;-) Just get the job done with the least complicated solution. It as faster (your boss may like that) and usually easier to maintain (you may like that).

A combobox is unfortunately something that was left out of the HTML specifications.
The only way to manage it, rather unfortunately, is to roll your own or use a pre-built one. This one looks quite simple. I use this one for an open-source app although unfortunately you have to pay for commercial usage.

The best way to do this is probably to use a third party library.
There's an implementation of what you're looking for in jQuery UI and in dojo. jQuery is more popular, but dojo allows you to declaratively define widgets in HTML, which sounds more like what you're looking for. 
Which one you use will depend on your style, but both are developed for cross browser work, and both will be updated more often than copy and paste code.

You can accomplish this by using the <datalist> tag in HTML5.
<input type="text" name="product" list="productName"/>
<datalist id="productName">
    <option value="Pen">Pen</option>
    <option value="Pencil">Pencil</option>
    <option value="Paper">Paper</option>
</datalist>

If you double click on the input text in the browser a list with the defined option will appear.

A little CSS and you are done

<div style="position: absolute;top: 32px; left: 430px;" id="outerFilterDiv">
<input name="filterTextField" type="text" id="filterTextField" tabindex="2"  style="width: 140px;
    position: absolute; top: 1px; left: 1px; z-index: 2;border:none;" />
        <div style="position: absolute;" id="filterDropdownDiv">
<select name="filterDropDown" id="filterDropDown" tabindex="1000"
    onchange="DropDownTextToBox(this,'filterTextField');" style="position: absolute;
    top: 0px; left: 0px; z-index: 1; width: 165px;">
    <option value="-1" selected="selected" disabled="disabled">-- Select Column Name --</option>
</select>

Very simple implementation (only basic functionality) based on CSS and one line of JS code
<div class="dropdown">
    <input type="text" />
    <select  onchange="this.previousElementSibling.value=this.value; this.previousElementSibling.focus()">
        <option>This is option 1</option>
        <option>Option 2</option>
    </select>
</div>

Please note: it uses previousElementSibling which is not supported in older browsers (below IE9)
.dropdown {
    position: relative;
    width: 200px;
}
.dropdown select
{
    width: 100%;
}
.dropdown > * {
    box-sizing: border-box;
    height: 1.5em;
}
.dropdown select {
}
.dropdown input {
    position: absolute;
    width: calc(100% - 20px);
}

JSFiddle

This can be achieved with the help of plain HTML, CSS and JQuery. I have created a sample page: 


$(document).ready(function(){
   
    $(".editableBox").change(function(){         
        $(".timeTextBox").val($(".editableBox option:selected").html());
    });
});
.editableBox {
    width: 75px;
    height: 30px;
}

.timeTextBox {
    width: 54px;
    margin-left: -78px;
    height: 25px;
    border: none;
}
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
<div class="wrapper">
    <select class="editableBox">        
        <option value="1">01:00</option>
        <option value="2">02:00</option>
        <option value="3">03:00</option>
        <option value="4">04:00</option>
        <option value="5">05:00</option>
        <option value="6">06:00</option>
        <option value="7">07:00</option>
        <option value="8">08:00</option>
        <option value="9">09:00</option>
        <option value="10">10:00</option>
        <option value="11">11:00</option>
        <option value="12">12:00</option>
        <option value="13">13:00</option>
        <option value="14">14:00</option>
        <option value="15">15:00</option>
        <option value="16">16:00</option>
        <option value="17">17:00</option>
        <option value="18">18:00</option>
