How do you re-attach a subversion local copy to a different remote?
svn
Our subversion repository has been moved to a new host, and we have old applications that connect to that host.  We CANNOT add an alias for the new server with the old name, how can we re-connect our checked out clients to the new repository?


Look up the svn switch command. In particular, the --relocate option is what you want.

SVN command line - see svn switch
TortoiseSVN - see relocate dialog

Example:
svn switch --relocate \
    http://svn.example.com/path/to/repository/path/within/repository \
    http://svnnew.example.com/new/repository/path/within/repository

One thing which is to remember, lets assume you checked out the project "path/within/repository" then you have to go to the root of your working copy, and execute the above command. it is NOT enough just to use the repository root (as in svn switch --relocate http://svn.example.com/path/to/repository/ http://svnnew.example.com/new/repository/), because that wouldn't work.
