XML Editor for OS X
xml osx
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12073/what-is-the-best-xml-editor was a great question regarding XML editors on Windows. What about on OS X?
Oxygen is feature complete, but, it's a Java app and a  bit clunky on OSX. It's also extremely expensive.
Anything Mac native and comparable in features for less than $300 ?
Thanks

EditiX XML Editor (starts at $60) or maybe oXygen ($299 is less than $300, right).
You'll find a big list of the optiosn over at XMacL if you want more choices.

It's been a long time since I used Oxygen, but in the latest builds of eclipse (gannymede) there is a built in XML editor that works for about 90% of my use cases (XSD/DTD validation, auto-complete etc.)
Obviously eclipse is a Java application and therefore may feel clunky for you, but, worth a try from my perspective as it is a lot cheaper than $300
If you are after extensibility in your tool then look at using TextMate and an appropriate Bundle (or extend an existing bundle with new macros).

If you use TextMate, there are plugins available such as http://ditchnet.org/xmlmate/

The latest JEdit Builds on the 4.3 branch combined with a wealth of plugins give you a lot of advanced XML/SLT/XQuery functionality.  
The downsides are it's still a Java Application, with all the lipstick on a pig implications that brings.  You'll also find inconsistent UI Metaphors in the various plugins.  There's a lot of poking and prodding you'll need to do, and last time I checked the JEdit forums there was a lot of "you idiot, it works like this" going on. 
The upsides are free and legitimately powerful.  I'm a BBEdit user, but I keep JEdit around for writing XQuery.

Emacs has a nice XML mode, if you don't mind running that on os x.

Netbeans could be a good and free choice too.
