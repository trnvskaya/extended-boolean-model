Domain redirection to the same page and Google
http redirect seo
We developed a website for a client and he has purchased the .com, .net, .info versions of the domain.
Is there any way to redirect all to the same page without being considered by Google as duplicated content and therefore penalized in the ranking position?


Just use the permanent redirect.
