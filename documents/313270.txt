How to make Eclipse prompt me for command line arguments
eclipse
I know I can configure command line arguments in the Run configuration but I want to run a java file multiple times with different command line arguments. It's a pain to change the Run Configuration every time.
Is there a way I can make Eclipse prompt me for command line arguments every time I run the program?


Add string_prompt as a Program Argument in the Run configuration.
 ${string_prompt}

There are also a file_prompt and a folder_prompt if you want specifically files\folders.
These are available through the Variables button on the (x)= Arguments tab of the Run Configuration dialog.

In addition you can add a string to the prompt by using ${string_prompt:My Prompt Text} which will show the dialog box with 'Please input a value for My Prompt Text'.

This is an old question, but since I really don't see this extra info anywhere else
You can also type ${string_prompt:My Prompt Text:Default Value}
And that will pop up a window asking 'Please input a value for My Prompt Text' and then with a default value of 'Default Value'.
