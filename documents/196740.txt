How to add NUnit in Visual Studio
asp.net visual-studio nunit
I need to write test cases for my application. I've chosen NUnit. Please let me know how to add NUnit to my Visual Studio IDE. where can I download them?


Best place to start would probably be: http://testdriven.net/
They have NUnit, and a host of other unit testing suites that can integrate with various versions of Visual Studio, as well as some documentation on them.

Your question is a bit ambiguous..   

Are you interested in learning nunit (In which case nunit.org would be the place to look along with some books on TDD/UnitTesting)
If you're trying to integrate nunit with VisualStudio IDE, I'd go with the external executable approach listed as Option#1 here or TestDriven.net Option#2
