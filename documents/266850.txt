Possible Causes for a Large Number of Sleeping Connections to a MySQL Server?
php mysql codeigniter connections
What are possible causes for a large number of sleeping connections to a MySQL Server? I'm using CodeIgniter with persistent connections disabled.


could be a timeout issue

Doesn't code igniter use a connection pool by default? If so, it will grab a bunch and hang on to them till it needs them.

Even though the app doesn't keep the connection open, the OS lets it hang around. See http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2006/11/12/are-php-persistent-connections-evil/
