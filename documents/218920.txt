How can I open a port in iptables for RMI access
linux rmi iptables
I'm trying to connect from my Java application to a development server that has port 8088 closed which is used for RMI. I appreciate any help on how to open that port.


Slicehost have some good documentation on setting up iptables on Ubuntu:

Assuming 

you want to allow access from everywhere
you want to allow access via the first ethernet device (eth0) 
you want to allow access to port 8088 using tcp

then you could try running

iptables -I INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 8088 -j ACCEPT

as root.
