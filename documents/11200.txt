T-Sql date format for seconds since last epoch / formatting for sqlite input
tsql sqlite date
I'm guessing it needs to be something like:
CONVERT(CHAR(24), lastModified, 101)

However I'm not sure of the right value for the third parameter.
Thanks!

Well I'm trying to write a script to copy my sql server db to a sqlite file, which gets downloaded to an air app, which then syncs the data to another sqlite file. I'm having a ton of trouble with dates. If I select a date in air and try to insert it, it fails because it's not in the right format... even if it was a valid date to begin with. I figured I'd try to experiment with the unix time since that's the only thing thats worked so far. I am considering just leaving them as varchar because I don't sort by them anyway.


Define "last epoch". Does this come close?
Select Cast(lastModified As Integer)

Last epoch is when 1970 GMT?
SELECT DATEDIFF(s,'19700101 05:00:00:000',lastModified)

See also Epoch Date

If you store them as varchar, store them as YYYYMMDD. That way you CAN sort by them later if you want to.

SQL server has only 2 failsafe date formats
ISO = YYYYMMDD, run this to see that 
  select convert(varchar(10),getdate(),112)

ISO8601 = yyyy-mm-dd Thh:mm:ss:mmm(no spaces) run this to see that 
select convert(varchar(30),getdate(),126)

To learn more about how dates are stored in SQL server I wrote How Are Dates Stored In SQL Server?

I wound up using format 120 in MS SQL: 
convert(char(24), lastModified, 120)

Each time I needed to a select a date in SQLite for non-display purposes I used:
strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\", dateModified) as dateModified

Now I just need a readable/friendly way to display the date to the user!
edit: accept answer goes to whoever shows me how to display the date nicely from sqlite ;p

sqlite> select datetime();
2011-01-27 19:32:57
sqlite> select strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S','now');
2011-01-27 19:33:57
