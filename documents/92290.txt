How to make visualstudio .net work with VB6 and service pack 6
visual-studio
I have VB application that requires visual service pack 6 to run , now when I install visualstudio.net (any version of .net)  Its debugger doesn't work properly ,I am able to create windows/web application in visualstudio.net but not able to debug anything  , so I have to keep 2 computers , one for VB and one for .net , does anybody have any idea what is the cause for this and is there any fix for this ?


I've used visual studio 6 and visual studio 2005 on the same system, so I know you can set it up so that both debuggers work.  However, when I did it the setup just worked, so I can't tell you what I did to make it work, except that VS2005 was on the machine first.
