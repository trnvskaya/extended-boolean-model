What's the best static analysis tool for NetBeans 6.1?
netbeans plugins
I'm finding a couple for Java in general but no plugins for netbeans that I can see.
Thanks


I've used the PMD NetBeans plugin, and here are the installation instructions (may be a little outdated, due to the speed of NetBeans development, but I got them to work).
Here's a list of tools for static analyisis.  Maybe you can cross-check for others that offer NetBeans support.
EDIT: Those instruction are a little bit old, so I put a more up-to-date set here (links to my blog).

I found the SQE Plugin, it integrates FindBugs, CheckStyle and PMD into one convenient Plugin.  
CheckStyle configuration was not complete yet, but the functionality is there in full.
