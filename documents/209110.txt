MFC: Showing / Hiding Splitter Panes
c++ windows mfc csplitterwnd w32
In my application I have a number of panes from m_wndspliter classes. What I want to do is at run time show and hide one of these panes. Whilst with the following code I can show and hide the view associated with the pane, I can't temporarily remove the pane itself. 
CWnd * pCurView = m_wndSplitter2.GetPane(2, 0);
if( !pCurView == NULL )
{
    if( fShow )
    {
        pCurView->ShowWindow(SW_SHOW);
        RecalcLayout();
    }
    else
    {
        pCurView->ShowWindow(SW_HIDE);
        RecalcLayout();
    }
}

Any examples / ideas ?
Thanks all.


You need to call CSplitterWnd::DeleteView to do this, which basically means that you have to save your CView elsewhere if you intend to restore it.  Usually this is not a problem as all data should be stored in the CDocument rather than CView, but in practice this may not be the case.
The way I have handled this in the past is to have a copy constructor for my CView classes so I could easily store them in temporary variables.

Does this help?

I have used something very similar myself,
