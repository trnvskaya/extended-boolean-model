What do you like/dislike about development user groups?
user group
I run a non profit based .net user group called DevEvening (http://www.devevening.co.uk) and am always looking to improve it. 
I wondered what people liked and disliked about user groups and what could persuade people to attend who did not already? 
Since your using this site I guess you have some outside of work interest in development - do you attend user groups?
I have been to a number of events and different user groups and although the quality of presentations etc have been mixed I find it is always interesting and useful talking to other developers. 


I don't much like developer user groups, as I find that the quality of feedback you get in a site such as this is so much better than you get in a limited geographical area.  The principal reason i'd attend is to meet someone I already knew from the web and maybe have a few beers.  That said, Microsoft are really making a more imaginative effort in this area, as shown by the emailed link I got this morning.  Way to go.
