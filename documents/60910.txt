Changing the font in Aquamacs?
osx emacs lisp aquamacs
I've recently had a need to do a bit of lisp editing and I found the nifty Ready Lisp package for OS X, which is great, except Aquamacs automatically uses a proportional font (which is idiotic, IMHO) and I want to change it to a monospace font. However, I'm not really much of an EMACS user, and the preferences menu in Aquamacs is less than clear on where and how one might make such a change. 


From the EmacsWiki Aquamacs FAQ:

To change the font used to display the
  current frame, go to the font panel.
  You can do this with the keystroke
  Apple-t, or via the menu: Options â
  Show/Hide â Font Panel. Once there,
  select the font you want.
To make the current frameâs font the
  default, go to Options â Frame
  Appearance Styles. Select âuse current
  style for foo modeâ, where foo is the
  mode of the current frame (e.g.,
  foo=text for text mode), to use the
  current style (including the font, but
  also any other changes youâve made to
  the frameâs style) for all files of
  this type. Select âuse current style
  as defaultâ to use the current style
  for all files for whose major mode no
  special style has been defined.

There are also recommendations for monospaced fonts - Monaco or "Vera Sans Mono".

This is what I have in my .emacs for OS X:
(set-default-font "-apple-bitstream vera sans mono-medium-r-normal--0-0-0-0-m-0-mac-roman")

Now, I'm not sure Bitstream Vera comes standard on OS X, so you may have to either download it or choose a different font. You can search the X font names by running (x-list-fonts "searchterm") in an ELisp buffer (e.g. *scratch* - to run it, type it in and then type C-j on the same line).

this is the one I use:
 -apple-DejaVu_Sans_Mono-medium-normal-normal-*-12-*-*-*-m-0-iso10646-1

You can set it in .emacs file like:
(set-default-font "-apple-DejaVu_Sans_Mono-medium-normal-normal-*-12-*-*-*-m-0-iso10646-1")

You can download it from dejavu-fonts.org

In Aquamacs 2.1, you can set the font through Options->Appearance->Font for Text Mode...   That brings up the standard font chooser window, choose the font you like.  Then, when you exit out of emacs (C-x C-c) you'll be prompted to save options, hit "y".
