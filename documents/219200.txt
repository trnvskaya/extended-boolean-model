How do you change the colors of the text when doing a Schema Compare in Visual Studio 2008 Database Edition?
visual-studio-2008 configuration colors color-scheme
I am trying to find out how to modify the Colors/Fonts used in the Schema Compare "Object Definitions" window that appears after a comparison is done between two databases.
The color scheme I have is unreadable, but I cannot seem to find the right settings in the Tools/Options/Environment/Fonts and Colors dialog.
Thanks for any help.
