Msg 64, Level 20, State 0, Line 0 SQL Server Error
sql-server-2005 stored-procedures
I am running a sproc on an SQL Server 2005 server which is resulting in the following error:

Msg 64, Level 20, State 0, Line 0 A
  transport-level error has occurred
  when receiving results from the
  server. (provider: TCP Provider,
  error: 0 - The specified network name
  is no longer available.)

Once the error occurs I loose my connection to the server, but able to reconnect.
There is nothing in the Event logs.
The database is still functional and running its website fine.
EDIT: This occurs every time I run this sproc, or it's called by an application.
Any suggestions on what may be causing this error?


Some thoughts:
This may be caused when you have connection pooling enabled, and for whatever reason, one connection in the pool loses its connection to the DB (due to a network hickup, or any other reason).
Is this happening everytime you call this sproc?
Does that sproc attempt to access a linked server?

This happens when the DB server is made unavailable with a client connection open.
To reproduce: If you have a query open in SSMS, restart the SQL instance, run the query again to get this error.
Thoughts:

Is the SQL instance being restarted?
Is the DB being closed automatically? (eg desktop editions, don't use them myself though)
Firewall issues?
