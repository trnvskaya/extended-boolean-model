ORM support for compound primary keys
.net sql orm primary-key compound-key
I've read that compound primary keys will confuse the hell out of typical ORM code generators. Which ORMs work best with compound PKs and which to avoid? (I've a particular interest in .NET)


I'm using NHibernate successfully with compound keys.
<class name="UserProfileField" table="UserProfileFields">
    <composite-id>
        <key-many-to-one name="Parent" column="UserId" lazy="false"/>
        <key-property name="FieldName"/>
    </composite-id>
...
