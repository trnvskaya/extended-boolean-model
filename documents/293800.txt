What is the difference between CIL and MSIL (IL)?
.net
Are these two terms interchangeable?


CIL is the term used in the CLI Standard. MSIL is (I suppose) CIL created by MS tools. Effectively they are synonymous.
Brad Abrams says this.

MSIL was the original name, but when it was turned into a standard it was renamed CIL.

Both the terms are similar but with following difference:
CIL â  Common Intermediate Language  â is the term used in the International Standard.  
MSIL â  Microsoft Intermediate Language   â is the product term for the Microsoft implementation of that standard.
