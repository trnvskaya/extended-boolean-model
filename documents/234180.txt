Flash Logging API
flex flash actionscript-3 air
Can anyone recommend a good (AS3) logging API for Flash/AIR/Flex?  I need something to capture and record mouse and keyboard events in addition to coded events.  Preferably something well documented/supported. Thanks in advance.


You must see http://sourceforge.net/projects/log4flash/
with no more.... 
bye bye

I would recommend Arthropod if you are looking for a development tool (this wasn't very clear in your question), if it's to log your client's behavior, I'm not aware of any tool sorry.

I've been using Thunderbolt. It allows you to see your log results in Firebug.

I always end up writing my own logging solutions. They generally are very simple compared to the rest of the project, and by writing my own I can tailor it exactly to what I need. Whereas using a pre-built one, always seems like either it is too over-engineered and complex to use, or it's too simple and lacking a couple features I need.

I developed and manage Loggee!, a Flash/Flex Logging Tool: http://davidbuhler.org/loggee-flex-logging-tool/

Try to use Log5F logging utility for ActionScript 3.0
