Execute a JavaScript function in a C# application
c# javascript scripting
Without using a WebBrowser control, how could I execute a JavaScript function, that is decoupled from any browser DOM dependencies, in a C# application?  I am investigating implementing validation rules only once, for both server and client validation.  See this question for reference if you like.  Are there any JS interpretor libraries I could use?
Addendum:
My goal here is to automatically deploy and invoke exactly the same validation logic on client and server, without communication between the two during the actual validation.  So, ideally I would code my validation logic in JavaScript, and render that to the page.  Alternatively, I could code my logic in C#, convert that to JavaScript using Script#, and render that to the page.  
I don't want separate validation functions being maintained client and server side, and I don't want AJAX calls to server validation functions, and I don't want client only or server only validation.


You could use JScript.Net
Either that, or investigate Script#

Windows Script Host (WSH) is a Windows administration tool. You can use PInvoke to activate it from C#. Recognizes an MS specific (and old) version of JavaScript.
WSH creates an environment for hosting scripts. That is, when a script arrives at your computer, WSH plays the part of the host â it makes objects and services available for the script and provides a set of guidelines within which the script is executed. Among other things, Windows Script Host manages security and invokes the appropriate script engine.

It uses the CodeDomProvider to execute the scripts, also check out this article for a more complex example.
