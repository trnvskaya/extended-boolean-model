Do I get a finished slot if a start QProcess using startDetached
c++ qt
Do I get a finished signal if I start a QProcess using startDetached()? I'm trying to start a process, but I need to be able to get an event when the process has terminated.


No you can't get a signal when you use startDetached because you have no object.
startDetached is a static function and when you call it the process is started directly without creating a QProcess object. Therefore, even if there was a signal you would not be able to connect it to anything since you have no object to connect from.
If you want a signal you should create a QProcess object and then call start on it. You will then be able to get the finished signal when the process finishes.
