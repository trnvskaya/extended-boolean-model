SVN - How to make an older revision the head revision?
svn
One of the files in my current head revision got corrupted. I want to make an older revision of that file the head revision as usually people sync to head revsion in my project. How to do that?


You should revert all changes since that old reversion. In principle,
svn merge -rHEAD:oldrev filename
svn commit -m "rolled back to oldrev"

should do. The later revisions are still there, but reverted.

You should do a reverse merge.
