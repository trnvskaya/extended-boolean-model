Enterprise Library Database Trace Listener?
enterprise-library
I'm using EntLib v4 for Logging and currently I'm saving the events to the default text file listener.
I would like to use MS SQL database as my event sink and I saw that the database listener is already provided, but I don't know how to create logging database and stored procedures?
After googling around I saw that in v3 the database creation scripts were shipped with the EntLib, but I can't find them in v4.


I just checked and its in the installation for the source.  On my machine its in C:\EntLib4Src\Blocks\Logging\Src\DatabaseTraceListener\Scripts.  
You can use the createloggingdb.cmd file or parse loggingdatabase.sql yourself for the relevant commands.
