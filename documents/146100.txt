Is it possible to programmatically change a user's screen saver and/or desktop background?

I have been asked to standardize the screen saver and desktop background used by everyone in my company and, aside from going around to each PC individually, I'm looking for a programmatic way to accomplish this.  I am not a systems admin, so have never crossed this bridge before.  It is also worth noting that most PCs are running Windows XP, however some are Windows Server 2003 and a few are Vista.

Why not just use Group Policies?
