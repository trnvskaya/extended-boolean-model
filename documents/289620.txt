File System indexing
c# .net
I am creating an application were I need to scan a directory hive to find a certain file.
I also want to better understand how indexing works.
Can anyone point me to any resource preferably in C# that shows how I can create a basic index for file system searching?


So, it sounds like you need a library for doing searches.
Lucene is a java search library, which has been ported to C#.
