Is there an equivalent of ComboBoxRenderer for NumericUpDown?
c# .net
I want to draw spinner controls, such as those found on a NumericUpDown, on a custom component.  If I want to draw a drop-down button, I can use ComboBoxRenderer.  Is there an equivalent of ComboBoxRenderer for NumericUpDown?


I do not think a ComboBoxRenderer exists in the Windows Forms namespace. You need to directly draw the UpDown control arrows (spin buttons) using interop and the Theme API. I don't have a complete sample for you, but you'll need
[DllImport("uxtheme.dll", ExactSpelling = true, CharSet = CharSet.Unicode)]
public static extern IntPtr OpenThemeData(IntPtr hWnd, String classList);

[DllImport("uxtheme", ExactSpelling = true)]
public extern static Int32 DrawThemeBackground(IntPtr hTheme, IntPtr hdc, int iPartId, int iStateId, ref RECT pRect, IntPtr pClipRect);

[DllImport("uxtheme.dll", ExactSpelling = true)]
public extern static Int32 CloseThemeData(IntPtr hTheme);

and you can find the required parts and states in this page (look for the SPIN style class and its associated parts and states).

Turns out there is.  See the VisualStyleElement.Spin class.
