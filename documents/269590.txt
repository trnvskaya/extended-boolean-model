JavaScript: Ci is not defined
javascript firefox continuous-integration
I just spent half an one our to find out what caused the Error-Message "Ci is not defined" in my JavaScript code. I finally found the reason:
It should be (jQuery):
$("asd").bla();

It was:
("asd").bla();

(Dollar sign gone missing)
Now after having fixed the problem I'd like to understand the message itself: What does Firefox mean when it tells me that "Ci" is not defined. What's "Ci"?

Update:
I'm using the current version of Firefox (3.0.3).
To reproduce, just use this HTML code:
<html><head><title>test</title>
<script>
("asd").bla();
</script>
</head><body></body></html>

To make it clear: I know what caused the error message. I'd just like to know what Firefox tries to tell me with "Ci"...


Assuming it's CodeIngiter, it can't find the js file.

I don't know which version of FF you are using, but regardless, the message is probably referring to the fact that bla() is not a function available on the String object. Since you were missing the $, which means you were missing a function, ("asd") would evaluate to a string, and then the JavaScript interpreter would try to call bla() on that object. So, if you had the following code in your project:
String.prototype.bla = function() {};

// now this next line will execute without any problems:
("asd").bla();

So, it is possible that Ci is some internal Firefox symbol that simply refers to the idea of a function. That is my guess, I imagine you are going to need someone that knows something about Firefox's internals to get a better answer to this question...

UPDATE: I am running your example code in the exact same version of FF as you are, but it reports the error as:

Error: "asd".bla is not a function
  Source File: file:///C:/test.html
  Line: 3

Perhaps you have an extension/plug-in running that does something with this? Maybe some Greasemonkey script or something?

Jason seems to be right. Many plugins (e.g. Firebug, Geode) use Ci as a shortcut:
const Ci = Components.interfaces;

So the plugins seem to cause that strange error message.
