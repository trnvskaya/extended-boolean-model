Creating Custom GnuCash Reports with Scheme
scheme
Are there any resources which show how to create custom GnuCash reports? I don't know the intricacies of Scheme but I do know the basics of Lisp, based on tinkering with Emacs. Is there a site which lays out the API for GnuCash reports, ideally with a little explanation of Scheme as well?


It appears that their wiki has some information here.

A good overview of creating custom reports with Scheme is also at http://www.widyono.net/prog/gnucash-xacc-repdev.html.
