TortoiseSVN - Ignoring files within a folder already in the repository
svn tortoisesvn ignorelist
How do I ignore all files within a folder under source control?
/project/published/ is a folder I want to keep
/project/published/some_file(s) are files/folders I don't want
More Details: Currently when I go to commit changes for my project I see a lot of files that I don't want to. They are files that get published to a folder and I don't need them under source control. I won't ever know the names of these files as they are chosen by users.
I tried to use the property svn:ignore with value published/* but that did not work. Any ideas?


Perhaps this can help you: in the Commit dialog there's a check box to "Show unversioned files". It's not the same as telling Tortoise/SVN to ignore them but might just do the trick. HTH

I'm guessing you tried:
svn propset svn:ignore published/*

svn propset needs the value and target seperated:
svn propset svn:ignore [value] [target]

...so try:
svn propset svn:ignore "*" published

(Don't forget the quotes.)

I've found a solution. If I set the svn:ignore property directly on the folder I want to keep (published) and set it's value to * then it does what I want. I would have liked to add this property to the project root but this works too.
prop - svn:ignore
value - *
Thanks for the suggestions.

You just right click on the published/ folder, select TortoiseSVN -> Properties, click New -> Advanced with the following:

Property name: svn:ignore 
Property value: *

Then it would work fine.
