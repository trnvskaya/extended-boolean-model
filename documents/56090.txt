Subversion merge history visualisation
svn merge visualization
Are there any utilities out there which can draw pictures of the merge history of a subversion repo - we always commit merges with a (fairly) consistent log message, and it would be handy to be able to automatically extract this info into a single picture that shows what branches occurred when, and what the state of merges is.
I'm just interested in an informational tool, not something to help with actually performing merges.


TortoiseSVN can show revision graph - visual representation of branching \ merging history and more.

I think Tortoise svn does not yet support version tree.
So far, Clearcase explorer is the best i've come across.

You can have a look at some of the visualisation techniques used here, for inspiration if you are developing your own system, some nice ideas.

Probably you know some of this already!

I use SmartSVN for this; I has a very quick and easy to use revision graph, which can show  svm:mergeinfo as colour coded links and arrows between branches.  It's pretty hard to beat when looking at a good-size source tree

The svn mergeinfo command provides an ASCII-art graph of the merges between two branches. You can also ask it to give you the revisions already merged, or needing a merge, in list format.
