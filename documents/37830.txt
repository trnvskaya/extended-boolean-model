How do I implement a chromeless window with WPF?
wpf user-interface
I want to show a chromeless modal window with a close button in the upper right corner.
Is this possible?


You'll pretty much have to roll your own Close button, but you can hide the window chrome completely using the WindowStyle attribute, like this:
<Window WindowStyle="None">

That will still have a resize border. If you want to make the window non-resizable then add ResizeMode="NoResize" to the declaration.

<Window x:Class="WpfApplication1.Window1"
    xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
    xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
    Title="Window1" Height="300" Width="300" WindowStyle="None" ResizeMode="NoResize">
    <Button HorizontalAlignment="Right" Name="button1" VerticalAlignment="Top" >Close</Button>
</Window>
