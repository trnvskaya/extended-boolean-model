PHP removing a character in a string
php string
My php is weak and I'm trying to change this string:
http://www.site.com/backend.php?/c=crud&m=index&t=care
to be:
http://www.site.com/backend.php?c=crud&m=index&t=care
removing the / after the ? on backend.php. Any ideas on the best way to do this?
Thanks!


$str = preg_replace('/\?\//', '?', $str);

Edit: See CMS' answer. It's late, I should know better.

While a regexp would suit here just fine, I'll present you with an alternative method. It might be a tad faster than the equivalent regexp, but life's all about choices (...or something).
$length = strlen($urlString);
for ($i=0; $i<$length; i++) {
  if ($urlString[$i] === '?') {
    $urlString[$i+1] = '';
    break;
  }
}

Weird, I know.

I think that it's better to use simply str_replace, like the manual says:

If you don't need fancy replacing
  rules (like regular expressions), you
  should always use this function
  instead of ereg_replace()  or
  preg_replace().

<?
$badUrl = "http://www.site.com/backend.php?/c=crud&m=index&t=care";
$goodUrl = str_replace('?/', '?', $badUrl);


$splitPos = strpos($url, "?/");
if ($splitPos !== false) {
    $url = substr($url, 0, $splitPos) . "?" . substr($url, $splitPos + 2);
}
