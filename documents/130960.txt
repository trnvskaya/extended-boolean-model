How can I provide custom error messages using JAXP DocumentBuilder?
java xml jaxp
I want to provide my own message from the validation done in DocumentBuilder, rather than the one from XMLMessages.properties.
Now I see that a property error-reporter needs to be set to a class which extends XMLErrorReporter.
However, I've not been able to get ComponentManager from Document/Builder/Factory.
Doing parsing of string in SAXParseException is the last option, but I'm just thinking there may be a 'best practice' way of doing it.


have you already looked at DocumentBuilder#setErrorHandler?
if yes, could you explain why this approach doesn't work for you?
