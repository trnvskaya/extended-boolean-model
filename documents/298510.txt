How to get the current directory in a C program?
c unix working-directory
I'm making a C program where I need to get the directory that the program is started from.  This program is written for UNIX computers. I've been looking at opendir() and telldir(), but telldir() returns a off_t (long int), so it really doesn't help me. 
How can I get the current path in a string (char array)?


Look up the man page for getcwd.

Have you had a look at getcwd()?
#include <unistd.h>
char *getcwd(char *buf, size_t size);

Simple example:
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <errno.h>

int main() {
   char cwd[1024];
   if (getcwd(cwd, sizeof(cwd)) != NULL)
       fprintf(stdout, "Current working dir: %s\n", cwd);
   else
       perror("getcwd() error");
   return 0;
}


Although the question is tagged Unix, people also get to visit it when their target platform is Windows, and the answer for Windows is the GetCurrentDirectory() function:
DWORD WINAPI GetCurrentDirectory(
  _In_  DWORD  nBufferLength,
  _Out_ LPTSTR lpBuffer
);

These answers apply to both C and C++ code.
