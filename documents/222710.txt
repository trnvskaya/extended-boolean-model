ASP.NET PasswordRecovery Control with Localized content
asp.net asp.net-membership
I am working on a simple portal application using the ASP.NET membership and login controls. I would like to use the PasswordRecovery control to send emails containing forgotten passwords, however my portal requires localization. I have an existing Content Management System that I am pulling the localized strings out of and I would like to link the PasswordRecovery control to that system.
But, it appears that the PasswordRecovery control will ONLY accept a .txt file for the email body...the property is PasswordRecovery1.MailDefinition.BodyFileName
I do not want to use a file on disk, I would like to use the localized content in my CMS.
Is there any way to do this? It occurred to me that I might be able to use the SendingMail event to send my OWN email through the normal System.Net namespace, but that seems sorta cludgy...
Any thoughts?
Thanks,
Max


Found this by googling "BodyFileName localization": 
http://forums.asp.net/t/1118242.aspx:

Just bind the property to a key in
  your page's localresource file. The
  page's local resource file is the file
  located in a subdirectory called
  app_localresources in your page's
  directory. Just use visual studio's
  "tools -> create local resource"
  option in design view for it be
  created for you.
In that file, create a string
  key/value pair with something like
Name: myBodyFileName
Value: myDefaultBodyFile.txt
Then bind this to the BodyFileName
  property of the login control with
  something like
'> 
Then just create the sattelite local
  resource files for other cultures and
  map that key/value pair in those
  resources to other body text files.
By the way, if you used visual studio
  to create the resource file for you,
  then the binding may have been done
  for you automatticaly. Just search for
  a
  "MyChangePasswordControlResource1.BodyFileName"
  key in the resource file or something
  similar.

Try handling the SendingMail event of the PasswordRecovery control.  In that event, set the e.Message.Body and e.Message.Subject properties to your localized text.
