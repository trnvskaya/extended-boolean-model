How can I convert HTML to Textile?
html textile
I'm scraping a static html site and moving the content into a database-backed CMS.  I'd like to use Textile in the CMS.  
Is there a tool out there that converts HTML into Textile, so I can scrape the existing site, convert the HTML to Textile, and insert that data into the database?


This is a simple markup replacement, nothing a good regex could not fix.
I recommend Perl, LWP::Simple and some regexes to do the whole thing (spidering, stripping design and menus, converting to textile, and then posting to the database.)

Here is a c# lib converting html 2 textile. Though it is textile with their additions. Not pure textile.

I know this is an old question, but I found myself trying to do this the other day and not finding anything useful, until I found Pandoc. It can convert loads of other markup formats as well - it's quite brilliant.

try this simple java code hope it work for you 
import java.net.*;
import java.io.*;

class Crawle
{

public static void main(String ar[])throws Exception
{


URL url = new URL("https://www.google.co.in/#q=i+am+happy");
InputStream io =  url.openStream();
BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(io));
FileOutputStream fio = new FileOutputStream("crawler/file.txt");
PrintWriter pr = new PrintWriter(fio,true);
String data = "";
while((data=br.readLine())!=null)
{
pr.println(data);
System.out.println(data);
}

}
}
}
