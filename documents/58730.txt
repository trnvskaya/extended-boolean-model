Open source PDF library for C/C++ application?
c++ c pdf open-source
I want to be able to generate PDF ouput from my (native) C++ Windows application. Are there any free/open source libraries available to do this?
I looked at the answers to this question, but they mostly relate to .Net.


LibHaru

Haru is a free, cross platform,
  open-sourced software library for
  generating PDF written in ANSI-C. It
  can work as both a static-library (.a,
  .lib) and a shared-library (.so,
  .dll).

Didn't try it myself, but maybe it can help you

If you're brave and willing to roll your own, you could start with a PostScript library and augment it to deal with PDF, taking advantage of Adobe's free online PDF reference.


LibHaru seems to be used by many.

A non-open source approach is: PDF Creator Pilot which provides more language options  including C++, C#, Delphi, ASP, ASP.NET, VB, VB.NET, VBScript, PHP and Python

It depends a bit on your needs. Some toolkits are better at drawing, others are better for writing text. Cairo has a pretty good for drawing (it support a wide range of screen and file types, including pdf), but it may not be ideal for good typography.

I worked on a project that required a pdf report. After searching for online I found the PoDoFo library. Seemed very robust. I did not need all the features, so I created a wrapper to abstract away some of the complexity. Wasn't too difficult. You can find the library here:

Enjoy!

muPdf library looks very promising: http://mupdf.com/
There is also an open source viewer: http://blog.kowalczyk.info/software/sumatrapdf/free-pdf-reader.html

PDF Hummus.
see for http://pdfhummus.com/ - contains all required features for manipulation with PDF files except rendering. 

http://wxcode.sourceforge.net/docs/wxpdfdoc/
Works with the wxWidgets library.

jagpdf seems to be one of them. It is written in C++ but provides a C API.

Try wkhtmltopdf
