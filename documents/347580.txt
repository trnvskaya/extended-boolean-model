Smarty Plugin for Eclipse Europa
php eclipse-plugin smarty eclipse-3.3
Are there any good Eclipse plugins for creating smarty templates? I am using Europa with PDT on Ubuntu (though I doubt the OS will make a difference for this).
I found SmartyPDT, but it did not seem to install properly and some of the discussions on it seemed to suggest it was for an older version of PDT.


You can find newer version of this plugin here :
 http://code.google.com/p/smartypdt/issues/detail?id=31
But I haven't installed it yet with my machine.

When I last used PHPeclipse (you know, the original PHP tools for Eclipse) around 2 years ago, it included a Smarty editor, but it was a bit rudimentary. I don't follow PHPeclipse development anymore, so maybe it has improved in the meantime.

I posted the same question a few hours ago, but just came across this post.  I thought I'd link my question from here, since neither of us have answers (and your question is 2 years old).
The smartyPDT plugin linked at google code is still not up to date for the latest version.

Answer posted on the linked-to question:

I've used both SmartyPDT and SSE*. 
SmartyPDT is finicky and it took some
  time for me to get it working.
  Unfortunately, after an OS reinstall
  my custom jars don't work anymore, so
  I've been using SSE.
It is quite basic but better than
  nothing.
It is described in English at
  bar54.
Download it from Google's translated
  version.
