Suggest a good PHP wiki engine
php wiki wiki-engine
I am looking for a small wiki engine that is easy to embed into an existing PHP application.  Or perhaps a set of libraries to handle all the typical wiki functions.
Currently I am using ErfurtWiki, but it is starting to show its age.  It hasn't been updated since 2005, and several of the pages on sourceforge appear to have been hacked.
I will be including it with a GPLv2 application so a GPL compatible license is important.
Edit:
To update, mostly I am just looking for text formatting/parser functionality.  I want to deal with the storage, security, rev history, etc on my own.


I highly recommend MediaWiki, the wiki engine that runs wikipedia.
EDIT: As per your comment, MediaWiki is highly embeddable. I've integrated it in numerous projects over the years.

Pear::Text_Wiki is another option, albeit it only handles the case of text formatting. It has not been updated since June of 2007, but includes several Wiki formats (all of which have other latest release dates).
The formats that Text_Wiki supports are:

BBCode: latest release: 2006-12-23
CoWiki: latest release: 2007-01-02
Creole: latest release: 2007-08-01
Doku: latest release: 2005-10-14
MediaWiki: latest release: 2006-04-10
Tiki: latest release: 2005-10-14

It has an LGPL license, so there should be no licensing problems with including in a GPL project.

I've used DokuWiki in the past and have been fairly happy with it. It's pretty small, the code isn't the cleanest, but it's not too tough to drop in your own authentication scheme (for example) to integrate with an existing user system.
It is GPL2, which fits your requirement. It uses the file system as storage, so may not scale that well, but for basic wiki stuff with a decent feature set it might be what you're looking for.

I like DokuWiki, but pmWiki might be better for you. Here's a list of all the PHP wikis: http://www.wikimatrix.org/search.php?sid=183
