How to work with pointer to pointer to structure in C?
c struct pointer-to-pointer
I want to change member of structure under double pointer. Do you know how?
Example code
typedef struct {
    int member;
} Ttype;

void changeMember(Ttype **foo) {
   //I don`t know how to do it
   //maybe
   *foo->member = 1;
}



maybe (*foo)->member = 1 (if it's dynamically allocated)

Try
(*foo)->member = 1;

You need to explicitly use the * first.  Otherwise it's an attempt to dereference member.

Due to operator precedence, you need to put parentheses around this:
(*foo)->member = 1;


You can use a temp variable to improve readability.  For example:
Ttype *temp = *foo;
temp->member = 1;

If you have control of this and allowed to use C++, the better way is to use reference.  For example:
void changeMember(Ttype *&foo) {
   foo->member = 1;
}
