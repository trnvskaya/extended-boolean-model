Is there a way to add a Subversion section to the right click menu for TextMate?
svn textmate
I'd like to be able to click on a file to revert it, or check in a directory, etc.  It would be much more convenient to have these available from the right click menu.


I don't think so. I'd recommend the SVNMate bundle though.

Have you seen this?
