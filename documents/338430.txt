Visual Studio 2008 sometimes won't open .aspx html markup
asp.net visual-studio visual-studio-2008
Every now and again I encounter a problem where Visual Studio Professional 2008 (SP1) refuses to open an aspx page.  My site is in a Web Application Project. 
Double clicking on the aspx page in solution explorer just causes the tree view node with the code behind and .designer.cs to collapse and expand, it's almost as if VS thinks the file is already open, but it's definately not. 
I've also tried right-click + View Markup or View Designer but no joy. I also tried unloading/reloading the project in solution explorer but that doesn't solve the problem either, I actually have to close the whole solution then re-open again (which can take a while if there's lots of projects in the solution).
This sometimes happens on just one or two files, others open without any problems. Anyone else seen this and know of any work arounds and cause?
Cheers

Yeah, I'm getting that with just one aspx file in a webproj. I can open it with notepad fine, no one else is having a problem with the file on their computer and it just started happening to me today.
I am using SourceSafe if that matters. I tried closing and reopening VS.

Do you have any extras/ plugins installed? I've seen problems like this that were fixed by uninstalling DevExpress add-ons
