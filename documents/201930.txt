Using server-side XML Parser to generate HTML content
html xml xpath xslt
Is it possible using a server side XML parser to have it create an HTML blob that is then included in an existing HTML page?


Is the existing HTML page already being served by the same server? If so, then yes - arguably that's a rough description of what almost all web frameworks do, to a greater or lesser extent: insert some dynamic content within a static template.
Which bit are you concerned about?

Most languages should have XML libraries or parsers available to facilitate this. 
For example, PHP has an XML parser.
Write a function using this to take a given XML feed, pretty it up, and spit it out. Then call this function in your HTML page.
