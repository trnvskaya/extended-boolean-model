Source Control for different teams?
version-control
Need recommendations for this...
I have 2 teams

Enterprise SOA development with InfoPath 2003, BizTalk 2006, MSCRMv3, custom .net2 website and a bunch of webservices using VSStudio 2005 with TFS.
Web Team focused on public facing websites - using Adobe Suite, VSStudio 2005.

As mentioned team 1 have TFS- we dont do daily/weekly/fornight/intergration builds as we dont do that type of methodology - but we do have a custom build/test solution using msbuild plumbed into TFS.  (it does other funky things like zips for archive the version/delist biztalk, deploy new assemplies in biztalk and renelist of biztalk and a full deploy of the website and services)
Team 2 have nothing... other than a zip archive of versions.
Issues...

TFS is expensive
Both teams are used to the "locking school" of source control.
need source control for differing assests

Any suggestions - OSS or other wise?


svn - can even keep your locking strategy (if you have to), also you can develop all sorts of pre/post commit hooks to automate deployments/tests etc etc. Easy to setup and manage.
Some tools & links

visualsvn server - free
tortoise svn - explorer add-in - free
visual svn - visual studio addin ($49 per seat)


I would go with TFS for both teams despite the expense. You have the expertise in-house already for that product and it supports the locking model you like.
If cost is a problem, go with SVN for the web team, but purchase VisualSVN for Visual Studio integration and use TortoiseSVN for Explorer integration. I have found in the past that web teams tend to 'get' SVN a bit more quickly, especially with TortoiseSVN.

I work with Subversion, running VisualSVN Server, and TortoiseSVN and  AnkhSVN add-in for Visual Studio on client developer machines, its a really good setup, and all is OpenSource.
