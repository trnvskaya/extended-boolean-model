VMWare ctrl-z key binding, how to remove
keyboard-shortcuts vmware-server
When I Alt+Tab to my VM from my host the VM does not get keyboard input until I click inside it.  This is causing me an issue as it looks like the VM has control of the input (as the cursor is flashing away).  If while in this state, VMWare server has the focus rather then the application inside it, if you do ctrl+Z (normally for undo) it suspends the VM.
This is driving me barmey.  I have looked through all the options and preferences in VMWare Server and can't find anyway to disable this.
Anyone know how to disable this?


You could use a resource editor on vmware.exe to remove the keybinding for ctrl-z.  Obviously not for the faint of heart.

This will not remove the key binding from VmWare, but you could set the option to "Grab keyboard and mouse intput on key press" in the VmWare preferences. VmWare help explicitly states that this will disable the system accelerator key sequences.
