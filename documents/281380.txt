Format Date with fmt:formatDate JSP
jsp jstl
I am trying to format a date with: 
<fmt:formatDate value="${newsletter.createdOn}" pattern="MM/dd/yyyy"/>

newsletter is an object with a createdOn property which is java.util.Date.
When I invoke the previous sentence I get: 
According to the TLD, the attribute value does not accept expressions.   
I am importing fmt with 
<%@ taglib prefix="fmt" uri="http://java.sun.com/jstl/fmt" %>

Does anyone know how can I work around this problem?
I am using the jstl.jar coming with tomcat. 
Under jstl.jar/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF stays: 
Manifest-Version: 1.0
Ant-Version: Apache Ant 1.5.3 
Created-By: 1.4.2-b28 (Sun Microsystems Inc.)
Specification-Title: JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library (JSTL)
Specification-Version: 1.1
Implementation-Title: JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library API Refere
 nce Implementation
Implementation-Version: 1.1.0-D13
Implementation-Vendor: Sun Microsystems, Inc.
Implementation-Vendor-Id: com.sun
Extension-Name: javax.servlet.jsp.jstl

I am using Apache Tomcat Version 6.0.14


Are you sure you're not using the runtime versions of the tag lib? May we see the library import statement?
I think lucus is onto something, according to this FAQ on JavaRanch, that's a JSTL 1.0 declaration. You might want to update to 1.1. 
What's your environment, app server, and version?

Try 
<%@ taglib prefix="fmt" uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/fmt" %>


Are you using the fmt-1_0-rt.tld or fmt-1_0.tld taglib.
The difference is the settings for rtexprvalue
In one, this is false, in the other it is true.

Are you using JSTL 1.0 or 1.1? formatDate in 1.1 should accept expressions.

Apparently, i needed 1.1 but i had to change the library import statements for both c and fmt.
Now it works. Thanks for the help, and sorry for the confusion. 
<%@ taglib prefix="c" uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core" %>
<%@ taglib prefix="fmt" uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/fmt" %>


This guy seems to have worked around the problem by extracting the TLD from the jar, modifying it, placing it in the WAR's WEB-INF directory, and adding an entry to his web.xml like this: 
<jsp-config>
 <taglib>
  <taglib-uri>http://java.sun.com/jstl/fmt</taglib-uri>
  <taglib-location>/WEB-INF/fmt.tld</taglib-location>
 </taglib>
</jsp-config>

In the end, he switched to the 1.1 declaration:
<%@ taglib uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/fmt" prefix="fmt"/>


It just worked for me by adding "_rt" to taglib url like this:
<%@ taglib prefix="fmt" uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/fmt_rt" %>

I found it in this article
have fun!

I encountered the same issue. 
I Changed 
<%@ taglib  prefix="fmt" uri="http://java.sun.com/jstl/fmt" %>
to
<%@ taglib  prefix="fmt" uri="http://java.sun.com/jstl/fmt_rt" %>
and it worked for me!

<%@ taglib uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/fmt" prefix='fmt'%>

is working for me.
