CSS : Bad Gray Line to the side of the Navigation Bar on http://perl-begin.org/
html css
I'm maintaining the Perl Beginners' Site and used a modified template from Open Source Web Designs. Now, the problem is that I still have an undesired artifact: a gray line on the left side of the main frame, to the left of the navigation menu. Here's an image highlighting the undesired effect.
How can I fix the CSS to remedy this problem?


It's the background-image on the body showing through. Quick fix (edit style.css or add elsewhere):
#page-container
{
   background-color: white;
}


That is an image. (see it here: http://perl-begin.org/images/background.gif) It's set in the BODY class of your stylesheet.

I think it's this:
#page-container {
    border-left: solid 1px rgb(150,150,150); border-right: solid 1px rgb(150,150,150); 
}

However, I'm not seeing why the right border isn't showing up....

The grey line is supposed to be there.  The reason why it looks odd is because the very top is hidden by the buffer element.  Remove the background-color rule from this ruleset:
.buffer {
    float: left; width: 160px; height: 20px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; background-color: rgb(255,255,255); 
}


I would do a quick fix on this to add the style:
border-left:2px solid #BDBDBD;

to the .buffer class
.buffer {style.css (line 328)
   background-color:#FFFFFF;
   border-left:2px solid #BDBDBD; /* Grey border */
   float:left;
   height:20px;
   margin:0px;
   padding:0px;
   width:160px;
}


I found the problem. 
The problem is that you need to set a white background on #page-container. As things stand, it has a transparent background, so the 5pt left margin on navbar-sidebanner is revealing the bg of the page_container ... so change that bg and you're cool. 

Thanks to all the people who answered. The problem was indeed the transparency of the #page-container and the background image of the body. I fixed them both in the stylesheet.
