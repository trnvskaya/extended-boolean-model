How do I get rid of TagExtraInfo JSTL warning in Eclipse?
eclipse jsp jstl
I'm working with JSTL in Eclipse, using the WTP.  I have jstl and standard.jar in my WEB-INF/lib directory, and everything works.  Eclipse is giving me this warning in my JSP:
The TagExtraInfo class for c:forEach (org.apache.taglibs.standard.tei.ForEachTEI) was not found on the build path.
I have JSTL included:
<%@ taglib uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core" prefix="c"%>

The warning is on a line that uses a c:forEach.  How can I get rid of it?
My project is targeting Tomcat v6.


Are the jars actually on the build path?  If so, you might try closing and reopening the project.  Otherwise that message is controllable from the Web/JSP Files/Validation preference page.

Add the standard.jar from the web-inf directory to your build path jars.

Eventually, I accidentally double-clicked the warning, and it took me to the source, which was editable.  Then I fixed the problem myself.
