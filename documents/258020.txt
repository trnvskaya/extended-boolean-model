"Functionoids"?
c++ boost
I've read the description of "functionoids" here. They look like a poor-man's version of Boost::function and Boost::bind. Am I missing something? Is there a good reason to use them if you're already using Boost?


No. 
Alternatively see the FQA answer here.

My vote goes to tr1::function. 
Functors or functionoids represent the base from which tr1/boost::function has evolved. The limit with common-interface functors is that they break the OO-paradigm since they represent different types and can only passed to template functions (unless you provide a base class from which they derive from).
Indeed by means of the type erasure technique tr1::function overcomes this limit: They are best used to implement dynamic strategy classes.
