Good Resource Loading System
flex actionscript-3 resources
I'm currently looking for a resource management system for actionscript3. More specifically in this case, I'm looking for opinions on off-the-shelf resource loaders/managers from people who have used them, 

are they clean/simple to use? 
are they designed to be extended?
I plan on using this with an MVC like system, Mate is next on the list, has anyone else used a resource loader in this manner?

bulk-loader



I've been very happy with bulk-loader.  We've integrated it with Parsley's MVC and IoC frameworks - http://spicefactory.org/parsley/ - with great success.
