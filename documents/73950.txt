Combine PDFs c#
c# pdf-generation
How can I combine multiple PDFs into one PDF without a 3rd party component?


AFAIK C# has no built-in support for handling PDF so what you are asking can not be done without using a 3rd party component or a COTS library.
Regarding libraries there is a myriad of possibilities. Just to point a few:
http://csharp-source.net/open-source/pdf-libraries
http://www.codeproject.com/KB/graphics/giospdfnetlibrary.aspx
http://www.pdftron.com/net/index.html

The .NET Framework does not contain the ability to modify/create PDFs. You need a 3rd party component to accomplish what you are looking for.

I don't think you can.
Opensource component PDFSharp has that functionality, and a nice source code sample on file combining

As others have said, there is nothing built in to do that task. Use iTextSharp with this example code.

Although it has already been said, you can't manipulate PDFs with the built-in libraries of the .NET Framework.  I can however recommend iTextSharp, which is a .NET port of the Java iText.  I have played around with it, and found it to be a very easy tool to use.

ITextSharp is the way to go

I don't think  .NET Framework contains such like libraries.  I used iTextsharp with c# to combine pdf files. I think iTextsharp is easyest way to do this. Here is  the code I used.
string[] lstFiles=new string[3];
    lstFiles[0]=@"C:/pdf/1.pdf";
    lstFiles[1]=@"C:/pdf/2.pdf";
    lstFiles[2]=@"C:/pdf/3.pdf";

    PdfReader reader = null;
    Document sourceDocument = null;
    PdfCopy pdfCopyProvider = null;
    PdfImportedPage importedPage;
    string outputPdfPath=@"C:/pdf/new.pdf";


    sourceDocument = new Document();
    pdfCopyProvider = new PdfCopy(sourceDocument, new System.IO.FileStream(outputPdfPath, System.IO.FileMode.Create));

    //Open the output file
    sourceDocument.Open();

    try
    {
        //Loop through the files list
        for (int f = 0; f < lstFiles.Length-1; f++)
        {
            int pages =get_pageCcount(lstFiles[f]);

            reader = new PdfReader(lstFiles[f]);
            //Add pages of current file
            for (int i = 1; i <= pages; i++)
            {
                importedPage = pdfCopyProvider.GetImportedPage(reader, i);
                pdfCopyProvider.AddPage(importedPage);
            }

            reader.Close();
         }
        //At the end save the output file
        sourceDocument.Close();
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        throw ex;
    }


private int get_pageCcount(string file)
{
    using (StreamReader sr = new StreamReader(File.OpenRead(file)))
    {
        Regex regex = new Regex(@"/Type\s*/Page[^s]");
        MatchCollection matches = regex.Matches(sr.ReadToEnd());

        return matches.Count;
    }
}
