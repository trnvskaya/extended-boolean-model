Adapt an Apache mod_rewrite RewriteRule not to act on physical directories
apache mod-rewrite
I have this RewriteRule that works too well :-)
RewriteRule ^([^/]*)/$ /script.html?id=$1 [L]

The bad thing about this rule is that it also matches physical directories which I don't want.
How can I tell the mod_rewrite to ignore physical directories and apply the above rule only when the directory matched does not exist?


Take a look at RewriteCond. Put the following before your rule to exempt out directories and files
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f


RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^([^/]*)/$ /script.html?id=$1 [L]
