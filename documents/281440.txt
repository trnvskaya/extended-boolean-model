Is there an ORM for Perl?
perl orm

create table person
(
    name varchar(15),
    attr1 varchar(15),
    attr2 varchar(1),
    attr3 char(1),
    attr4 int
)

How I can use basic ORM in Perl by taking a simple table like the one above and mapping it to Perl objects?  Next I'd like to perform basic operations like select results using some criteria system Perl like syntax. eg.:
@myResults = findAll(attr1 == 3 && attr2 =~ /abc/);



Rule #1, don't write your own.
There are quite a number of ORMs on CPAN, including ...

DBIx::Class - probably #1 in popularity at the moment
Rose::DB::Object
Fey::ORM - my own contribution, most notable for being Moose-based, which means you get all the power of Moose in your ORM-based classes.


(Chiming late) Data::ObjectDriver (also on CPAN) provides great flexibility especially if partitioning and caching is on the list of your requirements.

Of the suggestions I'd use DBIx::Class.  Here's some code to introspect a 50 table legacy database (with relationships specified in the schema):
#!/usr/bin/perl
use warnings;
use strict;
use DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader qw/ make_schema_at /;

make_schema_at("Zotero::Schema",
               {
                   # components => ['InflateColumn::DateTime'],
                   debug => 1,
                   relationships => 1,
                   dump_directory => './lib' ,
               },
               ["dbi:SQLite:dbname=../zotero.sqlite", "",""]);
