In ruby, why does my IRB interactive debugging session always say "No sourcefile available"
ruby
Just trying to get my irb sessions to actually list the current line of code, and those around it.  Similar to what Perl's -d debugging mode lets you ddo.


Its because, when you are doing it interactively, your "sourcefile" is std-in. 

If you are looking for a Ruby debugger you could try ruby-debug. It lets you set a breakpoint and then step through the code while displaying a context around the current instruction.
