Zend framework; Getting controller to use different viewer
php zend-framework
I am using the Zend Framework.
I have a controller named 'UserController' that has a public function displayAction().
I would like to know how I can get that action method to use a different viewer than the default display.phtml.
Any help is appreciated.


You can use 
$this->render('actionName');

or, alternatively, you can call a view script directly by calling
$this->renderScript('path/to/viewscript.phtml');

For more information, you can take a look at http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.controller.actionhelpers.html, specifically the parts about the render() and renderScript() methods.

Lately, I've been getting errors with the method described above (using ZF 1.11.11). I've had success with this:
$this->_helper->viewRenderer('action');
