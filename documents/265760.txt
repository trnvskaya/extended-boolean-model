Generating PDFs with PHP
php pdf dompdf
I have a PHP application and a need to generate a PDF with the result of query. The easiest way a found to do this was to use the DOMPDF to generate the PDF for me. So a made a function that generates the HTML for me then a pass this to DOMPDF. In the development and testing enviroment everything was fine but on production enviroment I had some problems with memory usage.
So I would like to know if my strategy was the best one or if there's a better and easy way to do this.
How would you do that?


Fll out a latex template and call Xetex over it.
I think you'll find the results pleasing at Letterly.

I once did a PHP project generating PDF. I used FPdf.
I never had any memory problems. It's free, it's pure PHP code. You don't have to load any extensions.
I don't know if there's some helpers to auto-generate document from a query, but in the website, you have some scripts that shows how to use it with MySql.

There is a PDF extension for PHP but it's not great - however the Zend framework does have a class that makes good use of it - I reccommend trying that. I haven't heard of DOMPDF before.

I use EZPDF pretty much weekly.  It's very easy to use, has great helper functions, but still lets you get in & do the nitty gritty detail work when you have to.

PrinceXML is a good alternative. It can cost a bit, but very powerful and easy to use.

I'm amazed nobody uses FOP:) http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/ ... you basically feed it an XML flie and it generates a PDF file... very quick, and dosent kill your server.
