How can I filter out the rows which contain a particular column with null or empty data in SQL?

In SQL, How we make a check to filter all row which contain a column data is null or empty ?
For examile  
Select Name,Age from MEMBERS

We need a check Name should not equal to null or empty.


nvl(Name, 'some dumb string') this will return Name if Name is not null and different of '' (oracle, don't know for others). It will be equal to 'some dumb string' if null or equal to ''.

This will work in all sane databases (wink, wink) and will return the rows for which name is not null nor empty
select name,age from members where name is not null and name <> ''


Select Name,Age from MEMBERS where name is null or name = ''
you can find and learn anymore from http://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp

Depending on the Database being used; try
Select Name, Age from Members
where name IS NOT NULL
if you need to filter the otherway
Select Name, Age from Members
where name IS NULL
Certain RDBMS treat enpty string different from null, and you would need to add;
Select Name, Age from Members
where Name IS NOT NULL
OR Name <> ''

For DBMSs that treat '' as a value (not null), Vinko's query works:
select name,age from members where name is not null and name <> ''

For Oracle, which treats '' as a null, tha above doesn't work but this does:
select name,age from members where name is not null

I tried to think of a "DBMS-agnostic" solution, but failed - mainly due to the different concatenation operators/functions used by different DBMSs!

T-SQL
select name,age from members where COALESCE(name, '') <> ''
