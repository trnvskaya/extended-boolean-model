Toolbar and treeview Icons missing when displaying CHM file using HH API
chm html-help
Just encountered an interesting problem. I have a CHM file. If I display it using Process.Start it displays correctly.
If however I launch it using the HH API it displays without any icons in the toolbar and treeview; the main content, including graphics, displays correctly. Here's what it looks like - with a few article titles scribbled out: 
The same file works fine on a colleagues machine with the same setup.
Any thoughts as to what's going on?


It seems that the problem was that I was giving HH API a relative path to the help file. Now that I'm using an absolute path the problem seems to have gone away.
