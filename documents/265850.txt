How to query range of data in DB2 with highest performance?
sql database pagination db2
Usually, I need to retrieve data from a table in some range; for example, a separate page for each search result. In MySQL I use LIMIT keyword but in DB2 I don't know. Now I use this query for retrieve range of data.
SELECT * 
FROM(
   SELECT  
      SMALLINT(RANK() OVER(ORDER BY NAME DESC)) AS RUNNING_NO
      , DATA_KEY_VALUE
      , SHOW_PRIORITY
   FROM 
      EMPLOYEE
   WHERE 
      NAME LIKE 'DEL%'
   ORDER BY
      NAME DESC
   FETCH FIRST 20 ROWS ONLY
) AS TMP
ORDER BY 
  TMP.RUNNING_NO ASC
FETCH FIRST 10 ROWS ONLY

but I know it's bad style. So, how to query for highest performance?


Not sure why you are creating the TMP table.  Isn't RUNNING_NO aready in ascending sequence?  I would think:
SELECT SMALLINT(RANK() OVER(ORDER BY NAME DESC)) AS RUNNING_NO,
       DATA_KEY_VALUE,
       SHOW_PRIORITY
  FROM EMPLOYEE
 WHERE NAME LIKE 'DEL%'
 ORDER BY NAME DESC
 FETCH FIRST 10 ROWS ONLY
would give the same results.
Having an INDEX over NAME on the EMPLOYEE table will boost performance of this query.

My requirement have been added into DB2 9.7.2 already.
DB2 9.7.2 adds new syntax for limit query result as illustrate below:
SELECT * FROM TABLE LIMIT 5 OFFSET 20

the database will retrieve result from row no. 21 - 25 

It's very difficult, it is depends which database do you have.
for example:
SELECT * FROM ( 
    SELECT 
      ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY ID_USER ASC) AS ROWNUM,  
      ID_EMPLOYEE, FIRSTNAME, LASTNAME 
    FROM EMPLOYEE 
    WHERE FIRSTNAME LIKE 'DEL%' 
  )  AS A WHERE A.rownum
BETWEEN 1 AND 25
