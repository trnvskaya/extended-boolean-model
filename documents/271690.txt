C# in linux environment
c# linux installation
I am currently working in C/C++ in a Unix environment and am new to Linux environments. I would like to learn about the Linux OS and learn C# as the next level of programming language for my career.
I decided to put Ubuntu Linux on my laptop. But I am not sure whether we can write, compile and run C# programs in Linux environments or not.
The only IDE I know for C# is MS Visual Studio. Is there are any possible way to work in C# in a Linux environment?
If I have no other option, I'll have both operating systems on my laptop - Vista to learn C# and Linux for the other OS.


Learn Mono.

The Mono Project is an open
  development initiative sponsored by
  Novell to develop an open source, UNIX
  version of the Microsoft .NET
  development platform. Its objective is
  to enable UNIX developers to build and
  deploy cross-platform .NET
  Applications. The project implements
  various technologies developed by
  Microsoft that have now been submitted
  to the ECMA for standardization.

You can use the MonoDevelop IDE.

MonoDevelop is a free GNOME IDE
  primarily designed for C# and other
  .NET languages.


Mono is an open source .NET compiler, runtime and library.
Monodevelop is an open source C# IDE, primarily intended for linux development. It includes a GUI designer.

You can also use wine, which is a free implementation of Windows' API.
For this :
 sudo apt-get install wine
then you'll be able to run Microsoft applications and do [almost] everything you like.
EDIT : My mistake, Visual Studio is not functional :-(

A Vista virtual machine in seamless mode running Visual Studio?  Then it will appear to integrate into your desktop like any other app, but you'll have the benefit of running the real MS stuff (with C#, having real MS is still a benefit rather than a liability).
