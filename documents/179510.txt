Is there a way to get rid of the selection rectangle when clicking a link which does not refresh the current page entirely?


Try adding this:
onclick="this.blur()"

Do you mean the dotted outline of a target?
Try:
:focus {
    outline: 0;
}

This would remove all focus outlines. IT's essentially the same as onclick in JavaScript terms. You might prefer to apply this to a:focus.
