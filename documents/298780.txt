How to do a jquery ajax call to a subdomain?
jquery ajax subdomain
i could call a page inside the same domain, but its not working when i calling a page in a sub domain due to security issues. what i have to do? help me!!!


You can set the document.domain but if I remember correctly a few browsers (Opera) will not even allow this. I am afraid your answer is to create some sort of proxy on the subdomain that you can talk through

Due to security reasons, most browsers don't allow ajax requests to different domains. So as far as I know, you won't be able to do that.

Use a script tag and the response should be a javascript callback.
Ex:
Instead of:
<script type="text/javascript">
jQuery.ajax({
    success: function(data) {
        alert(data.field);
    },
    dataType: 'json'
});
</script>

Do:
<script src="http://sub.domain.com/file"></script>

that will result with the following content:
data = {'field': 'bleh'}
alert(data.field);
