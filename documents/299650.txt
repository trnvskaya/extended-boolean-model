Excel workbooks produced by POI don't work when linked
java excel apache-poi
Here is what I'm doing :

Create a workbook in memory (book = new HSSFWorkbook(), ...)
Save it to disk (book.write(...))
Open in Excel (ok)
Create another workbook in Excel, which links to the first one (=PoiWorkbook?xls!A1)
Close Excel

Then everytime I open the second workbook again, all the links are #N/A, unless I also open the POI-generated workbook at the same time.
I never saw this behaviour with standard workbooks created in Excel.
Anyone has seen this and found a workaround ?
Thanks.


This issue seems to be solved by newer version of POI (using 3.6 right now).
