Initialising a struct variable to Nullable<int>
c# .net nullable
Is there a way to declare a variable as Nullable in c#?
struct MyStruct {        
    int _yer, _ner;

    public MyStruct() {

        _yer = Nullable<int>; //This does not work.
        _ner = 0;
    }
}



Try declaring your variable like this:
int? yer;


How about nullable types:
struct MyStruct
{
    private int? _yer, _ner;
    public MyStruct(int? yer, int? ner)
    {
    	_yer = yer;
    	_ner = ner;
    }
}


Try declaring _yer as type Nullable initially, rather than as a standard int.

_yer must be declare as int? or Nullable<int>.
    int? _yer;
    int _ner;

    public MyStruct(int? ver, int ner) {

        _yer = ver;
        _ner = ner;
    }
}

Or like this:
    Nullable<int> _yer;
    int _ner;

    public MyStruct(Nullable<int> ver, int ner) {

        _yer = ver;
        _ner = ner;
    }
}

Remember that structs cannot contain explicit parameterless constructors.
