What combination do you use for your polyglot solution?
polyglot
Those of us who use multiple languages to solve problems can combine them in a lot of ways.  Personally I use PL/SQL, XSLT, JavaScript, and Java plus the pseudo languages HTML, XML, CSS, Ant, and Bash.  What do you use? 


I have a D/MySQL/JavaScript[1]/HTML/CPP[2] app.
[1] compile time D template generated
[2] C pre-processor used to generate apache configs and SQL sprocs
Yes, I am trying to take things to the insane! ;)

Paraphrasing one of my favorite quotes:

Always write your code as if it were going to be maintained by a homicidal maniac that knows your home address.


I work on a desktop application, so my alphabet soup looks like: C# and C++ as well as XML and T-SQL.

Java + Clojure works very well as a combination for me.

Java is good for the low level code that needs to be well optimized. It also gives you access to the huge array of libraries in the Java ecosystem.
Clojure is great for rapid development of higher level code, working interactively in a REPL. It has great support for meta-programming and concurrency, and I often use Clojure to "glue together" Java based components into a working application.

It helps enormously that Java and Clojure run in the same JVM - calling between the two is very easy and has effectively zero performance overhead.
