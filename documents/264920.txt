Is it worth switching from Visual Studio 2005 to Visual Studio 2008?
.net visual-studio frameworks
As a team we are using Visual Studio 2005 with framework 3.0. I am thinking if it will be nice for us to switch to Visual Studio 2008 with framework 3.5 ? Is it worth it ?
Thanks.


Yes, it is 100% worth it. Visual Studio 2008 supports 2005 code (.net 2.0) completely. There are also a lot of improvements that you'll enjoy as you use 2008.

100% worth it, agreed.
Also switching to 3.5 with new projects (or easy to migrate ones) will help a lot with productivity. Even it you don't use features like LinQ.
Object Initializers and Automatic Properties will make your life much easier.
Also as said before, you can still develop 2.0 projects with VS 2008, so switching won't hurt at all.

Even if you can't use .NET 3.5 yet, the C# 3.0 language features (especially if you use LINQBridge) are well worth it. It also has better support for WCF etc (since you mention 3.0 - this is a kludge in VS2005).
Add to that the IDE improvements, and it is a no-brainer IMO.

The intellisense for C# is much improved

yes it is. works faster and more reliable
