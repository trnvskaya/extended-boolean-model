How can I get the X,Y position of a TWinControl (relative to the screen)
delphi delphi-2009
I'm trying to show a custom hint in a TWinControl but I can't figure out how to get it's position.
Using position 0,0 shows the hint on the top of my screen (outside the window) so I guess it must be the position of the control on the screen.
Edit:
I've found the TControl Property ClientOrigin which returns what I've expected, is it correct to use ClientOrigin.X and ClientOrigin.Y?


TControl.ClientToScreen gives you the screen coordinates for a given point within the control.
lPoint := Panel1.ClientToScreen(Point(0,0));
Label1.Caption := Format('Screen: %d, %d', [lPoint.X, lPoint.Y]);
