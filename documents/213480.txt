bring a console window to front in c#
c# console window
How can I bring a console application window to front in C# (especially when running the Visual Studio debugger)?


It's hacky, it's horrible, but it works for me (thanks, pinvoke.net!):
using System;
using System.Diagnostics;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;
using System.Threading;

public class Test 
{

    [DllImport("user32.dll")]
    [return: MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.Bool)]
    static extern bool SetForegroundWindow(IntPtr hWnd);

    [DllImport("user32.dll", EntryPoint="FindWindow", SetLastError = true)]
    static extern IntPtr FindWindowByCaption(IntPtr zeroOnly, string lpWindowName);

    public static void Main()
    {
        string originalTitle = Console.Title;
        string uniqueTitle = Guid.NewGuid().ToString();
        Console.Title = uniqueTitle;
        Thread.Sleep(50);
        IntPtr handle = FindWindowByCaption(IntPtr.Zero, uniqueTitle);

        if (handle == IntPtr.Zero)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Oops, cant find main window.");
            return;
        }
        Console.Title = originalTitle;

        while (true)
        {
            Thread.Sleep(3000);
            Console.WriteLine(SetForegroundWindow(handle));
        }
    }
}


Get two monitors (at least) and open VisualStudio in the secondary monitor.  When you run your app from within VisualStudio it will start up by default on the primary monitor.  Since it's the last app to be opened, it starts on top and changing over to VisualStudio doesn't affect it.  Works for me anyway.
If you don't already have a second monitor, IMHO, you should.

Alt + Tab?

This is what I would do. 
[DllImport("kernel32.dll", ExactSpelling = true)]
public static extern IntPtr GetConsoleWindow();

[DllImport("user32.dll")]
[return: MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.Bool)]
public static extern bool SetForegroundWindow(IntPtr hWnd);

public void BringConsoleToFront()
{
    SetForegroundWindow(GetConsoleWindow()); 
}


Quite a late answer, but I used the following work around:
If you are running a console application with Windows Forms, and you want to bring the console to the front of the form, there is no sane way to do this, as we've seen above. However, there is a way to do this with Windows Forms - you can use BringToFront() and SendToBack() to change the window layers in your program. My program had a form and a console - the console needed to be at the front, so I sent the form to the back.
Drawback: if your user is multitasking, and you want the console to be at the front of everything, this won't work. However, if you just want to affect the windows in your program, this is an adequate workaround.
