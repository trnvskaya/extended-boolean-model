Are there static analysis tools for Python?
python static-analysis pylint pyflakes
I am starting to use Python (specifically because of Django) and I would like to remove the burden for exhaustive testing by performing some static analysis.  What tools/parameters/etc. exist to detect issues at compile time that would otherwise show up during runtime? (type errors are probably the most obvious case of this, but undefined variables are another big one that could be avoided with an in-depth analysis of the AST.)
Obviously testing is important, and I don't imply that tests can be obviated entirely; however, there are many runtime errors in python that are not possible in other languages that perform stricter run-time checking -- I'm hoping that there are tools to bring at least some of these capabilities to python as well.


There's

pylint
pychecker
pyflakes

And probably others, too.

pylint is the best such tool I've found. Due to Python's nature it's difficult to statically analyze it, but it will catch undefined variables, basic type errors, unused code, etc. You'll want to tweak the configuration file, as by default it outputs many warnings I consider useless or harmful.
Here's part of my .pylintrc dealing with warning silencing:
[MESSAGES CONTROL]

# Brain-dead errors regarding standard language features
#   W0142 = *args and **kwargs support
#   W0403 = Relative imports

# Pointless whinging

#   W0212 = Accessing protected attribute of client class
#   W0613 = Unused argument
#   W0232 = Class has no __init__ method

You should check out Pyflakes, Pylint, and PyChecker. I've personally used both Pyflakes and Pylint, and found them both to be very helpful for catching those little things you hate to mess up on. Pylint generally requires a bit more configuration than Pyflakes.
Also noteworthy: Eclipse's PyDev plugin comes in with a built in Pylint output parser.

I echo the other answers and would just add that pychecker is the quickest and easiest to use and pylint the most comprehensive and configurable.
I also use epydoc a fair bit and this is good for pointing out problems with your docstrings.

Here are my first impressions of pyflakes, pychecker and pylint:

pychecker: It crashes frequently, most of the runs I tried resulted in Errors that originated in the pychecker code (eg: AttributeError or IndexError: list index out of range were the most common).  For some reason I had to set the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable before it would even run on any of the app code, and the documentation is very sparse.
pyflakes: 'pyflakes --help' throws a TypeError -- erm... Documentation is also very sparse, and pyflakes is very forgiving (as far as I can tell, it only reports compile errors, warnings, redefinitions, and some concerns about imports--such as unused and wildcards).  pyflakes also seems to repeat itself:

eventlist/views.py:4: 'Http404' imported but unused
      eventlist/views.py:4: 'Http404' imported but unused
      eventlist/views.py:5: 'from eventlist.models import *' used; unable to detect undefined names
      eventlist/views.py:59: 'authenticate' imported but unused
      eventlist/views.py:61: redefinition of unused 'login' from
  line 59
      eventlist/views.py:5: 'from eventlist.models import *' used;
  unable to detect undefined names 
     eventlist/views.py:4: 'Http404' imported but unused

pylint: This seems to be the most capable of the tools suggested.  It has the best documentation.  LogiLab provides a tutorial, pylint has a help screen, and there is a (broken) link to a user manual, which would be extremely helpful.  There are some issues with applying pylint to django, since pylint doesn't know about the django classes (such as models.Model).  This means that a fair number of otherwise valuable errors are generated about missing class fields.  eg:

E:105:get_events_by_tag: Class 'Tag' has no 'objects' member

Parsing these out automatically will be very difficult without some additional knowledge of the classes in use.  I'm not sure adding that is feasible, but it does seem likely that pylint is capable of dealing with this in the "right" way.  (I probably just need to point it to the django source, but there are no command line params that look likely, and, as mentioned earlier, the user manual is inaccessible.)

For the moment, I'm still looking into pylint -- pychecker and pyflakes need better documentation and they need to become more robust.

See our CloneDR, a tool for detecting duplicated code in spite of formatting changes, comment insertion/deletions, and even some changes to the code itself (replacement of one statement by another).
CloneDR works for a wide variety of languages (C, C++, C#, COBOL, Java, PHP, ...).  We recently added Python 2.6, and Python 3.0 isn't far off.

A great simple one that I use is Flake8 
-  It combines PyFlakes and PEP8

clonedigger helps you identify code duplication.
Update: unfortunately clonedigger seems not to be maintained any longer. 

PySonar2, an advanced Python static analyzer came out of two summer's working at Google by Yin Wang. He recently open sourced it and I ported it from being implemented in Java to Python. All the important tests are passing.

Another one is Prospector. This tool bundles several of the other static analyzers together and provides sensible defaults. Here's the pitch that got me to try it out:

Chances are, you will consider most of the warnings that come from
  tools like pylint or pep8 or pyflakes to be a bit picky. There are
  warnings about line length, there are warnings about whitespace on
  empty lines, there are warnings about how much space there is between
  methods on your class. What you probably want, however, is a list of
  actual problems in your code.

It's easy enough to use:
$ pip install --user prospector
$ prospector
