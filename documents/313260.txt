Serving contextual based ads on sites built entirely in Flash?
flash adsense ads
What's the status of adsense (or equivalent) being able to serve contextual based ads on sites built entirely in Flash?


Check out Mochiads. Adsense ish type of service for embedding into Flash applications.
(they're behind mochiweb, the erlang web server, which is way cool)
