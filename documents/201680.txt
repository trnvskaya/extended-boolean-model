How to integrate Geronimo's transaction manager in Tomcat?
tomcat jta geronimo transactionmanager
Does Geronimo provides a standalone transaction manager?
And if it does, is it possible to use it in Tomcat?


Apache OpenEJB is embedded implementation of Geronimo EJB container that includes Transaction Manager. OpenEJB can be embedded into Tomcat which is one of its intended usages.

If you specifically want the Geronimo TX manager, then see @grigory's answer.
If you're just looking for a free, open-source TX manager, though, the JOTM is a TX manager that embeds nicely inside Tomcat.
I should ask why you need this, though. If all you need to do is JDBC transactions against a single DataSource, then you don't need a TX manager. You only need one if you want to do full JTA transactions.

AFAIK, Geronimo uses Jencks that can be used standalone. But I can't say it's heavily documented. I'd rather consider using Atomikos or JBossTM.
