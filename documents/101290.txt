How many bits are there in a nibble?
binary
binary question :)


4 bits = 1 nibble
8 bits = 1 byte

I always understood a nybble to be 4 bits.  Spelling intentional as a nybble was half a byte.

Four

In computing, a nibble (often nybble or nyble to match the vowels of byte) is a four-bit aggregation, or half an octet.


A nibble (often, nybble) is the computing term for a four-bit aggregation, or half an octet (an octet being an 8-bit byte).

4 bits.  But I remember it being called a nybble instead of nibble, like byte versus bite.

0b100 bits, actually.

A nibble is normally bits BUT can refer to 2-7 bits, with 1 bit being a bit and 8 becoming a byte.

A nibble has 4 bits (although it doesn't have to). 
That also means that when you view a byte's value in hex-notation, one hex digit corresponds to one nibble. That's one reason why going from hex to binary is much easier than from decimal to binary.

The answer is 4 bits. 2 nibbles make a byte.
See here for a cute poem.

a Nybble or nibble is 4 bits. Early compter graphics used 4 bits of data fro color. as memory was precious two pixels were stored in one byte, a upper nibble and a lower nibble.
