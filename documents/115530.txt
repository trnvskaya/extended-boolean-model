In P4V, how do I create a branch from a label?
label branch perforce p4v
My company just imported our CVS repository into Perforce. I'm new to P4V and I can't work out how to create a branch from an existing label. Can anyone tell me how to do this?


In my copy of P4V (Version 2013.3), I go to the Actions menu and choose Branch Files..., which brings up the Branch Files dialog:

In that dialog, I specify the source files to branch, and the target name of my branch (in my case I am branching //depot/main/... to //depot/branch/...), and in the Filter tab I specify that I want to specify the source revisions using a label.
And I type my label name into the text box (If I don't know the label name I can Browse... for it).
Then I click the Branch button to make the branch.
