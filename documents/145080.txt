Distributing iPhone applications 2.1 vs 2.0
iphone app-store
Can iPhone applications compiled against 2.1 be successfully installed via iTunes on a 2.0 device?
I know iPhone applications compiled with 2.1 can run on a 2.0 device (assuming they're not using anything new from 2.1). But am not sure if iTunes will let the install take place.
Does anyone have concrete information on this?
I have not seen any apps on the AppStore that are 2.1+ only.


Short answer, yes.
There have been some apps that dont work 100% in 2.1, but the two firmwares are pretty much backwards compatible

I believe apps that are compiled against 2.1 will be marked as "Requires iPhone 2.1 Softwar Update" when viewed through iTunes. (but not when viewed from an iPhone - the iPhone's App Store app only displays a subset of an app's metadata.)
One example: Caliper (it's under "Application Description->Requirements")
I don't know if this "requirement" is actually enforced, however.

No.
As has been mentioned apps compiled with 2.1 will be marked as requiring 2.1 in iTunes. 
If you attempt to download a 2.1 app from the iPhone, or sync a 2.1 app via iTunes, you will receive a message that stated iPhone OS 2.1 is required.
