How to create instance of AxHost abstract class


You cannot create an instance of an abstract class.
You typically do not use the AxHost class directly. You can use the Windows Forms ActiveX Control Importer (Aximp.exe) to generate the wrappers that extend AxHost. 
See http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.axhost.aspx for an example.
