			$nogood = true;
			$status = "Message was not sent <p>";
			$status .= "Mailer Error: " . $mail->ErrorInfo;
		} else {
			$status = "Thank you! Your message has been sent to 20th Century Fox. Submit another?"; 
		}
	}
	return array('email_failed'=>$nogood, 'status'=>$status);
}

The above code keeps giving me the error, "Mailer Error: Language string failed to load: recipients_failedandrew@yahoo.co.uk". I have tried changing the AddAddress(). The smtp connection settings are correct, as this was the last error i had! Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks


It sounds like you have two problems.
1) Your language file isn't being loaded - see installation
2) The recipient is being rejected - errr double check the SMTP settings and the recipient address
