Ruby on Rails plugin for showing line numbers in log for SQL queries
sql ruby-on-rails logging
Does anybody know any plugin, that can show line numbers for SQL queries in Rails logs? Something like this:
User Load (0.003154)   SELECT * FROM `users` WHERE (`users`.`id` = 1) - (user.rb, line 24)

Thanks!


This plugin puts the stack trace in your logs.  As Daniel mentions it would be tricky to determine the line you wanted but I suspect you could work something out, and the trace itself may be good enough.

Be careful to set it up so you can turn it on and off.  I used this for awhile, and while useful for tracking down specific bugs, it drove me nuts if it was on all the time.
