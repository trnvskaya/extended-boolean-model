Overriding namespaces in gSOAP
c++ web-services gsoap
I am using gSOAP as a Web Service toolkit and have generated the stub and proxy classes through soapcpp2 from multiple WSDLs all at once. Thus all the namespace bindings are in a single .nsmap file.   
Now the problem is that all the namespace bindings are being sent with all the method calls I make. The HTTP POST packet is unusually large and ugly. 
Is there a way to programatically override the namespace bindings ?


Check soapcpp2 and its -q flag, it will help you.
Other than that, the -penv flag will pack basic gSOAP-related methods within the executable, not including any service objects.
Therefore the files generated with -penv can be shared across multiple namespaces, pertaining to different generated gSOAP Web Services.
