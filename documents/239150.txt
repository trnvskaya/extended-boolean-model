Sync Framework Resources

I am looking for resources on Microsoft Sync Framework. Although MSDN and Google Search gave me the brief overview, I want some demos and presentations.
Also, is Live Mesh based on Sync Framework?


Maybe those links will be helpful:

Tutorial - Microsoft Sync Framework Basics
SQL Express - Client Synchronization Sample
Sync Services for ADO.NET v2 - Download Only Sync
Sync Services for ADO.NET Adapter Builder


Live Mesh isn't based on the Sync Framework, although they both use FeedSync. There is collaboration between Live Mesh (Live Framework) and Sync Framework to develop a Live Framework provider for V2 of the Sync Framework. See the following presentation for details:

Sync Framework 2.0 has been released and the related MSDN documentation includes lots of examples.

For using NoSQL DB, couchbase mobile supports sync with couchbase server through Sync Gateway.  Very scalable solution.  http://www.couchbase.com/mobile#sync-gateway.
