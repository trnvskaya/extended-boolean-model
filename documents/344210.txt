How to determine total size of ASP.Net cache?
c# asp.net caching performancecounter
I'm using the ASP.net cache in a web project, and I'm writing a "status" page for it which shows the items in the cache, and as many statistics about the cache as I can find. Is there any way that I can get the total size (in bytes) of the cached data? The size of each item would be even better. I want to display this on a web page, so I don't think I can use a performance counter.


Have not tried it. But maybe you can use Cache Manager plug-in for ASP.NET. Or use it as example.

I am looking at my performance monitor and under the ASP.NET Apps v2.0.50727 category I have the following cache related counters:
Cache % Machine Memory Limit Used
Cache % Process Memory Limit Used
There are also a lot of other cache related metrics under this category.
These should be able to get you the percentage, then if you can get the total allowed with Cache.EffectivePrivateBytesLimit or some other call you should be able to figure it out. I do not have personal experience with these counters so you will have to do some research and testing to verify.
Here is a quick start article on reading from performance counters:
