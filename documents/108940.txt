How do I use (require :PACKAGE) in clisp under Ubuntu Hardy?
linux ubuntu lisp common-lisp asdf
I am trying to evaluate the answer provided here, and am getting the error: "A file with name ASDF-INSTALL does not exist" when using clisp:
dsm@localhost:~$ clisp -q
[1]> (require :asdf-install)

*** - LOAD: A file with name ASDF-INSTALL does not exist
The following restarts are available:
ABORT          :R1      ABORT
Break 1 [2]> :r1
[3]> (quit)

dsm@localhost:~$

cmucl throws a similar error:
dsm@localhost:~$ cmucl -q

But sbcl works perfectly:
dsm@localhost:~$ sbcl -q

Any ideas on how to fix this? I found this post on the internet, but using that didn't work either.


try this before anything else:
(require :asdf)

you can steal some ideas from the environment we use. it's available at: darcsweb
see environment.lisp that loads and sets up asdf for us. (sbcl has asdf already loaded)

The instructions you got mentioned SBCL explicitely, so it's expected that they'll work better using SBCL, I suppose. Some other Lisps don't come with ASDF or don't hook it up to CL:REQUIRE. In the former case, you'll have load ASDF yourself beforehand. In the latter case, you'll need to call (asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op ) instead of (require ).

wget http://cclan.cvs.sourceforge.net/checkout/cclan/asdf/asdf.lisp   
It worth checking out clbuild.  http://common-lisp.net/project/clbuild/
To get a lisp webserver up and running. You only need:
darcs get http://common-lisp.net/project/clbuild/clbuild
cd clbuild
chmod +x ./clbuild
./clbuild check
./clbuild build slime hunchentoot
./clbuild preloaded

Now a lisp repl will start. There you write:
* (hunchentoot:start-server :port 8080)

Testing that the server answer:
wget -O - http://localhost:8080/

use clc:clc-require in clisp. Refer to 'man common-lisp-controller'. I had the same error in clisp and resolved it by using clc:clc-require. sbcl works fine with just require though.
