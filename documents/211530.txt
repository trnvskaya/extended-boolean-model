Why global.asax Application_Error method does not catch exceptions thrown by ASMX service?
asp.net error-handling asmx
And how to fix it. I'd like to log every thrown exception for maintenance purpose.


This is a known issue in .Net - Application_Error never fires for a web service. Not sure if there's any reason it would be by design, but it just doesn't work.
Jeff Atwood had a post (and follow-up) about this a few years ago, with the following ideas:

Put a try-catch block around each web service method
Use a facade design pattern and include the try-catch in parent objects
Write a custom SOAP extension or HTTPModule

The only one I care for is the first one, even though it seems like a lot of work.

Application_error does not work on iis 7 by default.

For anyone looking for Microsoft's word on this topic, see here: "Handling and Throwing Exceptions in XML Web Services".
This is the relevant section:

A Web application can be comprised of multiple XML Web services, however the Application_Error event within the Global.asax file cannot be used for global exception handling. The HttpHandler for XML Web services consumes any exception that occurs while an XML Web service is executing and turns it into a SOAP fault prior to the Application_Error event is called.


Better: HttpApplication.Error event:
Note:

If your Web application contains XML
  Web services, you cannot use the Error
  event for global exception handling of
  those services. The HTTP handler for
  XML Web services consumes any
  exception that occurs in an XML Web
  service and converts it to a SOAP
  fault before the Error being called.
  To handle XML Web service exceptions,
  build a SOAP extension to process Web
  service exceptions in a custom global
  exception handler. For more
  information, see Handling and Throwing
  Exceptions in XML Web Services.
