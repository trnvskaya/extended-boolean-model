Tool for Viewing X.509 Certificates?
wcf certificate x509
Does anyone know of any good tools to view the store name, store location, or values of an X.509 Certificate?


i'm supposing that you are using Windows. So here it is http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa529278.aspx. It's a good tool, but to do it thru API is not hard and it's a good exercise to learn the API.

Portecle is cross-platform (written in Java), requires no installation and can not only read certificates and keystores but also create, modify, import/export etc.

Also, don't forget there's a substantial number of tasks and information you can view/manage directly from windows using the Certificates MMC console. 
For whatever reason, it's never in any menu by default, but you can just launch MMC.exe and then add the Certificate's snap-in. It's very useful for managing certificates deployed to your account's certificate store or to the machine certificate store (if you've got admin permissions).

See How to: Use the X.509 Certificate Management Tools on MSDN for instructions on how to use the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) Certificates snap-in to manage X.509 certificates.

Openssl does it better and with more details:
openssl x509 -in certificate.crt -text -noout
