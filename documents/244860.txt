Autocomplete on SQL Management Studio?
sql-server autocomplete ssms
Does anyone know if there's an add-in that does autocomplete for queries on SQL Management Studio?


Take a look at Red Gate's SQL Prompt.

And SQL Server 2008 has autocomplete/IntelliSense built in.

It's not Management Studio, but Toad has a freeware version with autocomplete.

You can also try Devart's free SQL Complete.

As previously pointed out, IntelliSense does not work in SSMS 2008 R2 if Visual Studio 2010 SP1 is installed.
I can confirm that upgrading to SQL Server 2008 R2 SP2 fixed the problem for me. IntelliSense now works in SSMS 2008 R2. Hooray!
