Not showing Dialog when opening file in Acrobat Pro using Applescript
osx adobe applescript acrobat
When opening Adobe Acrobat Pro, whether it be through Applescript or finder, the introductory dialog is shown.  Is there a way to not show this dialog without already having checked the "Don't Show Again" option when opening a document using Applescript?  
Photoshop and Illustrator Applescript libraries have ways of setting interaction levels and not showing dialogs, but I can't seem to find the option in Acrobat.


Copy any applicable preferences files in ~/Library/Preferences from a machine that you have checked "Don't show again" on.

If it's not in the dictionary, probably not.
