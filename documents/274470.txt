Creating a DLNA server/service in VB.NET
vb.net upnp dlna
I would like to create a DLNA server in VB.NET.
Since a lot of multimedia devices start supporting DLNA, i would like to see what is possible. Not only streaming video/audio and pictures but see what else can be done.
Anybody any starting points? protocol info, some basic code to get started?
DLNA is based on UPnP so i geuss that is the direction i have to start looking. 


You have to be a member of the DLNA community or pay $500 to be able to get a full specification of the protocol according to their homepage.
Intel has a tool for generating source code which is DLNA compliant at their hompepage. That could be a good start for just playing around and trying your ideas without having to buy the specification.

UPnP MediaServer using Intels SDK for Windows Home Server and Xbox 360 is written in C# and does not have all the functionallity required but it is a start.
I'd like to see an open source implementation of DLNA in .NET

You can get a lot of information about the various UPNP protocols, including DLNA from the UPNP website here.  This includes a zip file will all the service definitions and a list of existing SDKs from which you can start.  

This is a esy to understand 
UPnP AV Control Point VB.Net sample 

The Mono Project has a pretty good open source implementation of the UPnP protocol.
