Can I create a Visual Studio macro to launch a specific project in the debugger?
visual-studio visual-studio-2008 macros
My project has both client and server components in the same solution file.  I usually have the debugger set to start them together when debugging, but it's often the case where I start the server up outside of the debugger so I can start and stop the client as needed when working on client-side only stuff. (this is much faster). 
I'm trying to save myself the hassle of poking around in Solution Explorer to start individual projects and would rather just stick a button on the toolbar that calls a macro that starts the debugger for individual projects (while leaving "F5" type debugging alone to start up both processess). 
I tried recording, but that didn't really result in anything useful. 
So far all I've managed to do is to locate the project item in the solution explorer: 
 Dim projItem As UIHierarchyItem

 projItem = DTE.ToolWindows.SolutionExplorer.GetItem("SolutionName\ProjectFolder\ProjectName").Select(vsUISelectionType.vsUISelectionTypeSelect)

(This is based loosely on how the macro recorder tried to do it.  I'm not sure if navigating the UI object model is the correct approach, or if I should be looking at going through the Solution/Project object model instead). 


Ok. This appears to work from most UI (all?) contexts provided the solution is loaded: 
 Sub DebugTheServer()
    DTE.Windows.Item(Constants.vsWindowKindSolutionExplorer).Activate()
    DTE.ActiveWindow.Object.GetItem("Solution\ServerFolder\ServerProject").Select(vsUISelectionType.vsUISelectionTypeSelect)
    DTE.Windows.Item(Constants.vsWindowKindOutput).Activate()
    DTE.ExecuteCommand("ClassViewContextMenus.ClassViewProject.Debug.Startnewinstance")
 End Sub


From a C# add-in, the following worked for me:
Dte.Windows.Item(Constants.vsWindowKindSolutionExplorer).Activate();
Dte.ToolWindows.SolutionExplorer.GetItem("SolutionName\\SolutionFolderName\\ProjectName").Select(vsUISelectionType.vsUISelectionTypeSelect);
