Percentages of subtotal in a report
visual-studio-2008 report-designer
I am using Report Designer in VS 2008. Is there a way to display the percentages of a subtotal in a crosstab report?


I'm assuming you want something that looks like this:
ITEM_ID  |  AMOUNT  |  % OF TOTAL
-----------------------------------
    1    |    20    |     10%
    2    |    30    |     15%
    3    |    40    |     20%
    4    |    50    |     25%
    5    |    60    |     30%

The value of your Amount column, by default, should contain an expression like:
=Fields!Amount.Value
So the value of a percentage column would contain the expression:
=(Fields!Amount.Value / Sum(Fields!Amount.Value) * 100) & "%"
