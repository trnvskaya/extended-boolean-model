Two HTML tables side by side, centered on the page
css center alignment
I have two tables on a page that I want to display side by side, and then center them within the page (actually within another div, but this is the simplest I could come up with):
<style>
  #outer { text-align: center; }
  #inner { text-align: left; margin: 0 auto; }
  .t { float: left; }
  table { border: 1px solid black; }
  #clearit { clear: left; }
</style>

<div id="outer">
  <p>Two tables, side by side, centered together within the page.</p>

  <div id="inner">
    <div class="t">
      <table>
        <tr><th>a</th><th>b</th></tr>
        <tr><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr>
        <tr><td>4</td><td>9</td></tr>
        <tr><td>16</td><td>25</td></tr>
      </table>
    </div>

    <div class="t">
      <table>
        <tr><th>a</th><th>b</th><th>c</th></tr>
        <tr><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr>
        <tr><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>15</td></tr>
        <tr><td>8</td><td>13</td><td>104</td></tr>
      </table>
    </div>

  </div>
  <div id="clearit">all done.</div>
</div>

I understand that it's something to do with the fact that the tables are floated, but I'm at a loss as to understand what I'm missing. There are many web pages that describe something like the technique I show here, but in any event it doesn't work; the tables cling stubbornly to the left hand margin.


Off the top of my head, you might try using the "margin: 0 auto" for #outer rather than #inner.
I often add background-color to my DIVs to see how they're laying out on the view.  That might be a good way to diagnose what's going onn here.

The problem is that the DIV that should center your tables has no width defined. By default, DIVs are block elements and take up the entire width of their parent - in this case the entire document (propagating through the #outer DIV), so the automatic margin style has no effect.
For this technique to work, you simply have to set the width of the div that has margin:auto to anything but "auto" or "inherit" (either a fixed pixel value or a percentage).

Give your inner div a width.
EXAMPLE
Change your CSS:
<style>
#outer { text-align: center; }
#inner { text-align: left; margin: 0 auto; }
.t { float: left; }
table { border: 1px solid black; }
#clearit { clear: left; }
</style>

To this:
<style>
#outer { text-align: center; }
#inner { text-align: left; margin: 0 auto; width:500px }
.t { float: left; }
table { border: 1px solid black; }
#clearit { clear: left; }
</style>


The problem is that you need to give #inner a set width (anything but auto or inherit). The margin: 0 auto; trick only works if the inner element is narrower than its container element. Without being given a width, #inner is automatically expanding to the full width of #outer, which causes its contents to be flush left.

If it was me - I would do something like this:
<style type="text/css" media="screen">
 table { border: 1px solid black;float:left;width:148px;}
 #table_container{width:300px;margin:0 auto;}
</style>

With the table like:
<div id="table_container">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>a</th>
      <th>b</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>9</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>16</td>
      <td>25</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>a</th>
      <th>b</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>9</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>16</td>
      <td>25</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>


<style>
#outer { text-align: center; }
#inner { width:500px; text-align: left; margin: 0 auto; }
.t { float: left; width:240px; border: 1px solid black;}
#clearit { clear: both; }
</style>


Unfortunately, all of these solutions rely on specifying a fixed width. Since the tables are generated dynamically (statistical results pulled from a database), the width can not be known in advance.
The desired result can be achieved by wrapping the two tables within another table:
<table align="center"><tr><td>
//code for table on the left
</td><td>
//code for table on the right
</td></tr></table>

and the result is a perfectly centered pair of tables that responds fluidly to arbitrary widths and page (re)sizes (and the align="center" table attribute could be hoisted out into an outer div with margin autos).
I conclude that there are some layouts that can only be achieved with tables.

I realize this is an ancient question, but here goes anyway.
The following will work in compliant browsers and IE8 in standards mode (i.e. with a doctype set).
#inner {text-align:center;}
.t {display:inline-block;}

Unfortunately, there's really no way to tweak it to work in IE6. For IE7, adding a zoom:1 to the .t divs (via a conditional comment) might help, but I don't have IE7 available for testing at the moment.

I found I could solve this by simply putting the two side by side tables inside of a third table that was centered. Here is the code
I added two lines of code at the top and bottom of the two existing tables
<style>
  #outer { text-align: center; }
  #inner { text-align: left; margin: 0 auto; }
  .t { float: left; }
  table { border: 1px solid black; }
  #clearit { clear: left; }
</style>

<div id="outer">

  <p>Two tables, side by side, centered together within the page.</p>

  <div id="inner">
   <table style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
   <td>
    <div class="t">
      <table>
        <tr><th>a</th><th>b</th></tr>
        <tr><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr>
        <tr><td>4</td><td>9</td></tr>
        <tr><td>16</td><td>25</td></tr>
      </table>
    </div>

    <div class="t">
      <table>
        <tr><th>a</th><th>b</th><th>c</th></tr>
        <tr><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr>
        <tr><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>15</td></tr>
        <tr><td>8</td><td>13</td><td>104</td></tr>
      </table>
    </div>
    </td>
    </table>
  </div>
  <div id="clearit">all done.</div>
</div>
