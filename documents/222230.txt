IIS 7.0 Multiple Domain Site Bindings
iis iis-7 binding hosting dns
I've got three web sites each with its own domain going to my one Windows Server 2008 IIS 7.0 web server.

example1.com
example2.com
example3.com

The site bindings for each:



When I navigate to example1.com, then I see my example1 web site.
When I navigate to example2.com, then I see my example2 web site.
But, when I navigate to example3.com, I see my example1 web site--not the example3 web site I expect.
What's going on?  Why might example2.com work, but example3.com fail?

Issue resolved!
I removed and then recreated the example3.com web site within IIS and it's now working.
I didn't change anything.  It either originally had a simple typo or the act of recreating it just happened to fix a hiccup within IIS.

It's stopped working again after I setup additional redirects within IIS forcing web sites to use sub domains:
http://example1.com/ redirects to http://www.example1.com/
I've again removed and then recreated the example3.com web sites; I've reset IIS; I've rebooted the server.  It's still not working correctly.

I've figured it out.  It's not an IIS issue.  It's a DNS issue.
The example3.com traffic is for some reason directed to a web server at a different company. THEY serve up a page with only an HTML frame on it.  That frame loads a page with the address http://example3.example1.com.  That's what I need to handle on MY web server.


I would validate that you have example3.com pointing to the proper location on disk.  Also ensure that it is not stopped.
The fallback to example1 is due to the binding entry with no header value.
