How do I dictate the destination folder of a clickOnce application?


This is not possible with ClickOnce. ClickOnce applications are always installed in the Apps subdirectory of local application data.

As a further to the above, this is a security feature. Allowing websites to install software to arbitrary locations on someone's harddrive somewhat automatically is a bad idea.

One Click application directly installs into the user profile directory. There is no way you can install it to your Programme files. To customize the your application use Installaware Admin http://www.installaware.com/studio-admin-features.htm
