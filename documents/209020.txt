Aggregate Login Control [ASP.NET]
asp.net login
Is there a control out in the world that allows a user to log in to a website with MS Passport (Windows Live ID, whatever), Facebook, OpenID, etc. all in one control?
Thanks, everyone!


I am not aware of any control that allows all of them, but the API's are pretty simple that would allow you to implement it yourself.

As mentioned on StackOverflow podcast 30 - JanRain RPX has beaten me. Sad face for me.
