Is there any way to decode a PICS Rules File?
Contains settings and preferences used by the Windows operating system.
The file is given by:

The PICSRules spec defines what PICS rules should look like. I don't think your file is one of those.
Is that the entire file contents above?
Are you sure that it's definitely a PICS rules file? There are many file types which use the .prf extension, perhaps it's one of those.
