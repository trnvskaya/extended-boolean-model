Simple Question; Is there an easy way to check whether a .NET 1.1 assembly is debug-compiled or not?


It depends on how you want to check. If you want to check in code when you are actually running, if the code is in debug mode, you can use:
Debug.Assert(MyFunction())

Using that code, MyFunction will only run when the dll it is located in is compiled in debug mode.
