Custom URI for HTTPListener?
c# .net httplistener
Is there a way to add a custom prefix/URI that is not http or https? The HTTPListener.Prefixes.Add method only accepts http:// and https:// prefixes.
I just don't want to recreate the functionality of this class if I don't have to. 


What did you have in mind? Mainly, I doubt it; besides, it will still only handle http[s], so why confuse things with a different scheme name? You can listen on a different port by adding it to the prefix list (eg "http://127.0.0.1:90/"), though. If a client connects on that port using the correct protocol (http vs https) then it would probably work - you'd just have a lot of work to do at the client to tell it how to handle that scheme.
I'm not sure I see a point, to be honest...
