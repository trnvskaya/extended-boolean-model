Does a Poco to DataSet project exist?
c# dataset poco
I have a POCO object that goes 4 levels deep contained objects (like Invoice has line items that have taxes that have gl entries), and I want to turn the entire thing into a DataSet. So there would be 4 tables, each with constraints being applied to the parent table.
Does anyone know of something that would automated this?


How do you populate this object? If it's from the database, there are two methods to structure your query such that the dataset is populated with separate, automatically related DataTable-s. Old and probably not supported anymore is the SHAPE command.
A better and more recent approach is to use FOR XML. 
The later approach will also allow you to load a dataset from XML-serialized representation of your `POCO' (not FOR XML, but loading XML into DataSet)
