C# 4.0 Feedback
c# c#-4.0 feedback
Does anyone know the official method for submitting feedback on C# 4.0 so that Anders and his team will get the feedback and be able to respond to the submission?


Probably the forums here, or (for bugs) connect (they've added options for .NET 4.0 CTP and VS2010 CTP)

Have you come across the VS10 CTP feedback forum on MSDN: 
http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/category/vs2010ctp/
and the specific C# and VB forum:
