How do I get rid of .. Replace(Replace(Replace(Replace(Replace( â¦?
sql-server sql-server-2005
Iâm selecting data on an old database which has an abused status column.  The status column has multiple pieces of information in it.  Values are like âNew Contact YYYYâ, âOnline YYYYâ, âUpdated YYYYâ, âWithdrawn YYYYâ, etcâ¦. As you may have guessed, YYYY represents the year â¦ which I need.
In the past Iâve done something similar to 
Rtrim( ltrim( Replace(Replace(Replace(Replace(Replace( â¦

Basically, replacing all text values with an empty string, so the only thing that still exists is the year.  I can still do this, but Iâm thinking this is ridiculous, and thereâs got to be a better way.
Does anybody know of a better way to do this?


If you simply want to extract a four digit year from the string, you could use PATINDEX
SELECT SUBSTRING(FieldName, PATINDEX('%[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]%', FieldName), 4)
FROM TableName


If the year allways are the last 4:
SELECT right(FieldName,4) from table


All the answers given solve your problem, but the correct answer is to normalize your data base better. If you need the year as a separate item, it should be stored in a separate column.
Anything else is just removing hairs from a wart, as my dear old grandma used to say (she never actually said that, I just thought of it and it sounded kind of cool - must be why I don't get out much :-).
