Is there a webservice available for checking a person's credit score?
web-services
I'm developing an application that should automatically check a person's credit score and present him different payment options based on that score.
The closest I could find is Cortera Credit Pulse but it's meant for checking a business' credit score and not an indivdual's.
Thanks in advance!


A Google Search for 'credit score api' turned up this and this.

Here is a list of credit vendors you can check if they service your industry.
The vendor that you choose should provide an integration guide for you.
