Tools for manipulating PowerPoint files
c# .net powerpoint
Do you know managed tools for manipulating PowerPoint files?
The tool should be 100% managed code and offer the option to
handle .ppt and .pptx files.


Well, 100% managed could be going the hard route, however, you can use the Office PIAs from your .NET code. Joel Spolsky has an article discussing your various options.

@Chris: There won't be a chance that Office 2007 will be available to manipulate the files. So far the only solution which comes close to what I am looking for is Aspose.Slides for .NET. The support for .pptx files is "a work in progress" though.
