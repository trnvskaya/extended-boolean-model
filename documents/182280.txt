Alternative to Html.Button<T>?
asp.net asp.net-mvc controller action codeplex
I know the Html.Button has been moved to the Microsoft.Web.Mvc namespace, but I really miss the generic versions that used to exist in the early Previews. 
All I want the Html.Button to do is to hit an action in my controller, but I'd rather not write the JavaScript in the onClickMethod argument.
In my previous project I just snagged the generic Html.Button code from a previous preview release, but that doesn't seem like the best approach as things progress. There were also Html.NavigateButton... where is that and why should I have to recreate it?
How is everybody else doing this?


Yes, they really screwed up with Html.Button and Html.CheckBox in CTP5. I hope they return to the previous behaviour.

The problem with the generic versions is that filters are allowed to change the actual name of the action away from the name of the method (like the [ActionName] attribute).
