How can I access the bookmarks toolbar using only shortcuts in Firefox 3
keyboard-shortcuts firefox-addon shortcuts firefox-3 bookmarks
I am not interested in accessing the bookmarks menu or sidebar. The specific goal that I'm trying to accomplish is to be able to easily navigate (using only the keyboard) through the live bookmarks loaded from stack overflow by means of a feed reader and located on my bookmarks toolbar. 
Notes:

I have found an add-on that supposedly does exactly what I need:  Bookmark Keys, but unfortunately it doesn't work in firefox 3), and is not being currently maintained.
I'm using WinXP at work and Ubuntu 8.04 at home.

Edit: changed bookmark keys "not compatible" with firefox 3 to "not working" in firefox 3


Try this: 
Get the incompatible Bookmarkkey extension file (disable JS then you should copy link location on the download button), open it with your favorite archive manager (holly cow, it's a zip after all:o), then edit the .RDF file, which is vanilla xml (mozilla folks loves file extension renaming!):
and change the maxversion to this one:
< em:maxVersion>3.0+< /em:maxVersion> (Space added in tags for web display)
then save your xpi archive and install it in your browser.
Curse the lazy extension developers and enjoy!

This is the best solution that I found: Site Launcher extension.
