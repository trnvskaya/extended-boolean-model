How do I sort the columns in a winforms datagrid control into alphabetical order?
Thanks


Have you tried binding the DataGrid to a DataTable object (instead of a view) and turning setting the "AllowSorting" property to true on the DataGrid? I believe the grid will then automatically sort the table source for you.
If not, you can always catch the event when a column header is clicked and rebuild a DataView to bind to the DataGrid.

This MSDN article should guide you along the way.
If you provide more information perhaps we can provide actual code for your specific problem.

My items are generally lists of items in memory. With databound grids you have to sort the data at the source, not within the grid itself.
Here's the code for my list sorts. Maybe this will give you an idea for getting off the ground.
