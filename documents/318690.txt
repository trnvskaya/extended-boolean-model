asp.net sql timeout when not using sql
c# asp.net sql-server
Im in the process of learning asp.net 3.5, currently on webparts and co.
Ive started a new project for webparts, not using a database with it, but when i go to view the website (dev server), i get an sql timeout??

A network-related or instance-specific
  error occurred while establishing a
  connection to SQL Server.

Just to be clear, there is no mention of sql anywhere in the project.
Should i just start again?
Edit:
May be relevant

(provider: Shared Memory Provider, error: 40 - Could not open a connection to SQL Server)



The webparts infrastructure talks to a database.

Ok fixed, needed to enable/start sql server 2008 express
