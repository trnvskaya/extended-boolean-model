When building a Handler, should it be .ashx or .axd?
asp.net
Say I'm building an ASP.Net class that inherits from IHttpHandler, should I wire this up to a URL ending in .ashx, or should I use the .axd extension? 
Does it matter as long as there's no naming conflict?


Ahh.. ScottGu says it doesn't matter, but .ashx is slightly better because there's less chance of a conflict with things like trace.axd and others. That's why the flag went up in my head that .ashx might be better.

Out in "the wild", .ashx are definitely the most popular extension.
