Is there a way to set timeouts in tomcat?
java jsp tomcat timeout
Can I set timeouts for JSP pages in tomcat either on a per page or server level?


For server level, you can try this.
you have to change catalina.bat / catalina.sh file
jvm OPTIONS : -Dsun.net.client.defaultConnectTimeout=60000 -Dsun.net.client.defaultReadTimeout=60000 


In the Tomcat server.xml file, the Connector element also has a connectionTimeout attribute in milliseconds.
