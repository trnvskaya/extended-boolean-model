How to write your own .net obfuscator
.net obfuscation
I am very curious as to how people write their own obfuscator.
How hard would it be to simply do the following:

rename all public methods with GUID type names.

Where would I start?  How would I go about reading the .net dll assemby, pulling the public methods out and renaming them?  


You can check those two projects that are using Cecil to write an open-source obfuscator:

If you're starting with source, it's pretty simple to do text replacements and then run the code through a compiler.  If you are starting with a compiled assembly, then you need to use the stuff in the System.Reflection namespace to load the assembly and System.CodeDom to generate compilable code units.
