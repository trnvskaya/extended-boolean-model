Which jQuery plugin should be used to fix the IE6 PNG transparency issue?
jquery internet-explorer-6 png
Is there an IE6/PNG fix that is officially developed by the jQuery team?
If not which of the available plugins should I use?


Check this out. Some people mention jQuery plugins in the comments as well.
PNG Fix from 24 Ways

I'm using jquery.pngFix.js.  I don't know if it's officially sanctioned or not, I do know that it works.  I chose it because it was the plugin included with FancyBox, no other reason.  

This .htc pngfix has always worked for me, even in cases where the jquery plugin failed.

Hello Guyz, Here is my Fix to this problem
Download jQuery-Plugin "pngFix" from (http://jquery.andreaseberhard.de)
Great PlugIn By The Way!!!
--Change these lines like the following:
// this line
jQuery(this).find("img[src$=.png]:visible").each(function() { 
// this line
jQuery(this).find(":visible").each(function(){
// and this line
jQuery(this).find("input[src$=.png]:visible").each(function() {

--Before the end Place this Code
// Store a reference to the original method.
var _show = jQuery.fn.show;

// Overriding Show method.
jQuery.fn.show = function(){
  // Execute the original method.
  _show.apply( this, arguments );
  // Fix Png 
  return $(this).pngFix();
}

//No more problems with hidden images

})(jQuery);

//The End


Hey guys, just wanted to toss this one in. I was digging around for it again and it has one specific advantage over the rest: repeatable backgrounds, as well as background-position (the one thats flagged as the  best answer here actually just scales the background image).

It's so great. Just drop it in and forget its there. Have yet to see it explode a set of CSS.
