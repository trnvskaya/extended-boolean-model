Problem using the ASP.NET FileUpload control in an UpdatePanel?
asp.net ajax file
I'm running into an issue where I have a FileUpload control in an UpdatePanel.  When I attempt to save changes and upload the file, no file is found.  If I remove the UpdatePanel everything seems to work fine.  
Any ideas why this might be happening?  And is there a work-around?



To upload a file you need to perform a full ASP.NET page postback, it does not operate over the partial postback method.
You'll need to register the button which "uploads" your file as a PostBackTrigger of the UpdatePanel's triggers.
There are lots of free (and non-free) AJAX file upload solutions, or you can easily create one, it's just a matter of putting your file upload control within an iframe and submitting the iframe page back to the server. It isn't really ajax, but it gives a visual impression of AJAX.
