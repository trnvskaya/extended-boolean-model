Does Hostmonster support Django
django shared-hosting hostmonster
I know Hostmonster allows Python. Has anyone successfully run Django on there? Any problems? 


Well, if it support Python, you might be able to run Django using a FastCGI setup, as described here: FastCGI Docs. If it supports mod_python (which I guess it's what you mean), then sure, you can install it using the steps listed here: ModPython docs

I tried the archive the user posted there, and it worked like a charm.

Hostmonster uses cPanel (possible with CentOS), just like other host providers.   If you research into cPanel , you are more likely to get your answer.
Generally, the answer is "no" since out-of-the-box cPanel does not support python 2.5 or mod_wsgi. But it does support Apache2, so it's possible that hostmonster could use mod_wsgi to run sites built with Django. 

I know this is an old question, but here is the answer: yes, Hostmonster does support Django
There used to be this Hostmonster KB article for details, including instructions on how to set it up, but that link appears to be dead these days, and the only article about Hostmonster article about Django is about troubleshooting. You can find instructions on how to set up Django on Hostmonster elsewhere.
