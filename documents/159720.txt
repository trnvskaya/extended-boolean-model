What is the naming convention in Python for variable and function names?
python variables function naming-conventions
Coming from a C# background the naming convention for variables and method names are usually either CamelCase or Pascal Case:
// C# example
string thisIsMyVariable = "a"
public void ThisIsMyMethod()

In Python, I have seen the above but I have also seen underscores being used:
# python example
this_is_my_variable = 'a'
def this_is_my_function():

Is there a more preferable, definitive coding style for Python?


See Python PEP 8.

Function names should be lowercase,
  with words separated by underscores as
  necessary to improve readability.
mixedCase is allowed only in contexts
  where that's already the prevailing
  style

Variables...

Use the function naming rules:
  lowercase with words separated by
  underscores as necessary to improve
  readability.

Personally, I deviate from this because I also prefer mixedCase over lower_case for my own projects.

The coding style is usually part of an organization's internal policy/convention standards, but I think in general, the all_lower_case_underscore_separator style (also called snake_case) is most common in python. 

There is PEP 8, as other answers show, but PEP 8 is only the styleguide for the standard library, and it's only taken as gospel therein. One of the most frequent deviations of PEP 8 for other pieces of code is the variable naming, specifically for methods. There is no single predominate style, although considering the volume of code that uses mixedCase, if one were to make a strict census one would probably end up with a version of PEP 8 with mixedCase. There is little other deviation from PEP 8 that is quite as common.

Most python people prefer underscores, but even I am using python since more than 5 years right now, I still do not like them. They just look ugly to me, but maybe that's all the Java in my head. 
I simply like CamelCase better since it fits better with the way classes are named, It feels more logical to have SomeClass.doSomething() than SomeClass.do_something(). If you look around in the global module index in python, you will find both, which is due to the fact that it's a collection of libraries from various sources that grew overtime and not something that was developed by one company like Sun with strict coding rules. I would say the bottom line is: Use whatever you like better, it's just a question of personal taste.

Personally I try to use CamelCase for classes, mixedCase methods and functions. Variables are usually underscore separated (when I can remember). This way I can tell at a glance what exactly I'm calling, rather than everything looking the same.

David Goodger (in "Code Like a Pythonista" here)  describes the PEP 8 recommendations as follows:

joined_lower for functions, methods,
attributes, variables
joined_lower or ALL_CAPS for
constants
StudlyCaps for classes
camelCase only to conform to
pre-existing conventions


Typically, one follow the conventions used in the language's standard library.

As mentioned, PEP 8 says to use lower_case_with_underscores for variables, methods and functions.
I prefer using lower_case_with_underscores for variables and mixedCase for methods and functions makes the code more explicit and readable.  Thus following the Zen of Python's "explicit is better than implicit" and "Readability counts"

As the Style Guide for Python Code admits,

The naming conventions of Python's
  library are a bit of a mess, so we'll
  never get this completely consistent

Note that this refers just to Python's standard library. If they can't get that consistent, then there hardly is much hope of having a generally-adhered-to convention for all Python code, is there?
From that, and the discussion here, I would deduce that it's not a horrible sin if one keeps using e.g. Java's or C#'s (clear and well-established) naming conventions for variables and functions when crossing over to Python. Keeping in mind, of course, that it is best to abide with whatever the prevailing style for a codebase / project / team happens to be. As the Python Style Guide points out, internal consistency matters most.
Feel free to dismiss me as a heretic. :-) Like the OP, I'm not a "Pythonista", not yet anyway.

Google Python Style Guide has the following convention:

module_name, package_name, ClassName, method_name, ExceptionName,
  function_name, GLOBAL_CONSTANT_NAME, global_var_name,
  instance_var_name, function_parameter_name, local_var_name


I've varied the PEP system a little.  
ThisIsAClass
this_is_a_function

However, for variables I employ a system that goes a bit against Python's dynamic typing, but I find the improved readability at a glance so very useful, plus most variables don't ever change type in any case.  I start each variable with a small letter denoting what it is, followed by StudlyCaps.  An additional advantage is that variables and functions don't look the same.  For example:  
iIntegerVariable
rRealNumber         
oObject
fFile
lList
dDictionary
sString
xDynamicVariable

aNumpyArray

etc..


There is a paper about this: http://www.cs.kent.edu/~jmaletic/papers/ICPC2010-CamelCaseUnderScoreClouds.pdf
If you are lazy to read it it says that snake_case is more readable than camelCase. That's why modern languages use (or should use) snake wherever they can.
