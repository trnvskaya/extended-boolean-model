saslpasswd2: generic failure on Windows
windows svn sasl
I get a generic failure when I try to run:
saslpasswd2 username

This was installed by Collanet's Subversion 1.5.2.


The problem that I had was that the sasl executables are trying to access the sasldb file at:
C:\CMU\sasldb2

Make sure that you create the directory 
    C:\CMU
