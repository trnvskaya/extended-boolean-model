Using Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) in Delphi
delphi volume-shadow-service
Does anyone have sample code to copy open (in-use and locked by another program) files using Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) API?
There was an article about this in The Delphi Magazine (September 2005). But that code is no longer available and even if it was, it's not current.
I am looking for sample code that works with current version of Volume Shadow Copy service libraries.


there is a digital edition on usb stick of the "The Delphi Magazine".
you can order that on their webpage.
maybe someone has created a torrent of that stick.
update
i found that sample here:
http://www.google.com/codesearch/p?hl=de#XIdFp1PskBE/VSS/VssAPI.pas
Upper link is outdated, the header-files can also found here:

I found a working (XE2) example here:
http://www.rathlev-home.de/sources/delphi.html#progsxe2
For compilation with XE8 get the latest "gnugettext.pas"
This package contains all units necessary for compiling a delphi program which creates a volume shadow copy. In addition there is a example application VsToolkit available. I compiled it with XE2 and XE8 and it works just fine...
