Eclipse: Hide paths in the "Open resource" dialog
eclipse
Is there any way to define what the "Open Resource" dialog in Eclipse should show?
If you work with svn you don't want the *.svn files to show up. (I know there is a fix out for this one but does there exist a more general one?)


At the top-right corner of the "Open Resource" there is a small blue arrow.
Click it and "Select Working Set".
Create a new working set as required to include what you need

You could mark the files as 'derived', though depending on their directory structure it could be time-consuming.  See my answer to this question.
