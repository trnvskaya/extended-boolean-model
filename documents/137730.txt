How do I upload a HTML form with a username, password, multiple file uploads and then process it with PHP?
php html forms upload
How to post a username, password and multiple binary files from a single html form and process it using php? I'm not allowed to use ajax.


You should use the $_FILES superglobal and move_uploaded_file() function to see which files were uploaded successfully and move them to their final location in case they were.
The $_POST superglobal will contain the submitted username and password.

first off check out these pages on PHP.net

file upload info
move_uploaded_file

But to get you started here's a couple stub files.
uploadForm.html
<html>
<body>
    <form action="processStuff.php" enctype="multipart/form-data" method="POST">
    	username: <input type="text" name="username" />
    	password: <input type="password" name="password" />

    	<p>
    		<input type="file" name="uploadFile[]" /><br />
    		<input type="file" name="uploadFile[]" /><br />
    		<input type="file" name="uploadFile[]" /><br />
    		<!-- Add as many of these as you want -->
    	</p>

    	<p>
    		<input type="submit" />
    	</p>
    </form>
</body>
</html>

processStuff.php
<pre>
<?php

    echo '<h2>Username & password</h2>'
    echo "Username: {$_POST['username']}\nPassword: {$_POST['password']}";
    echo '<hr />';

    echo '<h2>Uploaded files</h2>'	
    foreach($_FILES['uploadFile']['tmp_name'] as $i => $tempUploadPath) {
    	if (empty($tempUploadPath)) {
    		// this <input type="file" /> was "blank"... no file selected
    	} else {
    	    // a file was uploaded
    	    echo '<strong>A file named "', $_FILES['uploadFile']['name'][$i], "\" was uploaded</strong>\n";
    	    echo "\ttemporarily stored at: ", $tempUploadPath, "\n";			
    	    echo "\tmime type: ", $_FILES['uploadFile']['type'][$i], "\n";
    	    echo "\tsize: ", $_FILES['uploadFile']['size'][$i], " bytes\n";			
    	    echo "\terror code", 
    	   	((empty($_FILES['uploadFile']['size'][$i]) 
                    ? '<em>no errror</em>' 
                    : $_FILES['uploadFile']['size'][$i])), 
    		"\n\n";

	// do something useful with the uploaded file 
    	// access it via $tempUploadPath and use move_uploaded_file() to move 
    	//     it out of the temp path before you manipulate it in any way!!!!!
    	// see http://us3.php.net/features.file-upload
    	// and http://us3.php.net/manual/en/function.move-uploaded-file.php
    	}		
    }

?>
</pre>

The HTML file shows how to set the enctype of the <form> & the second form show you how to access the submitted username & password & finally how to loop thru every uploaded file.
As noted you MUST move the file(s) ASAP. They're uploaded to a temp location and the system will delete them unless you deal with them. So move 'em somewhere first then do whatever you need w/ them.
Hoep this helps
