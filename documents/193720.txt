IIS 6 Tuning Guide?
iis optimization iis-6
I have been a developer for 10+ years and so far my IIS knowledge is just enough for deploying stuff on it and get it running. Recently I have been playing with IIS 6 and realize the huge difference on the worker process model. I think I would need some good guide to update my knowledge in this area. Any good article/book recommendation?


There are several online resources, starting with this one:
Performance Tuning (IIS 6.0)

www.iis.net - central place for everything related to IIS..

I recently came across this which I thought was very good: Best practices for creating websites in IIS 6.0

David Wang has some great articles on the inner workings of IIS6. For various reasons his blog was split over two sites:

And...Tess who is a MS escalation engineer has some amazing articles on debugging and diagnosing badly behaved/perfoming apps:

IIS Tuner is an open source tool for tuning IIS 6, 7 and 7.5
