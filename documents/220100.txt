How do I enable double-buffering of a control using C# (Windows forms)?
I have a panel control which I am drawing stuff into and also an owner-drawn tab control. Both suffer from flicker, so how can I enable double-buffering?


some info here:
How to double buffer .NET controls on a form?

In the constructor of your control, set the DoubleBuffered property, and/or ControlStyle appropriately.
For example, I have a simple DoubleBufferedPanel whose constructor is the following:
this.DoubleBuffered = true;
this.SetStyle(ControlStyles.UserPaint | 
              ControlStyles.AllPaintingInWmPaint |
              ControlStyles.ResizeRedraw |
              ControlStyles.ContainerControl |
              ControlStyles.OptimizedDoubleBuffer |
              ControlStyles.SupportsTransparentBackColor
              , true);


Use the DoubleBuffered property, inherited from the System.Windows.Forms.Control.
System.Windows.Forms.Form myForm = new System.Windows.forms.Form();
myForm.DoubleBuffered = true;
