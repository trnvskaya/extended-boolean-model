jQuery .Net Deployment Issue
.net jquery deployment
Just started getting into jQuery and have an issue with a jQuery Post call working perfectly on my local dev box (VS 2008 built-in web server), but failing when I deploy to a windows 2003 server (IIS 6) box.
The post works and the page being posted to process things correctly, but a response is never received by the calling Post function. The submitting page just reloads with no changes.
Here is my Post function (it is enclosed in the $(document).ready(function() {...
The alert in the response function never fires:
        $('.nextButton').click(function() {

            var idString = '';

            $("div.dropZone > div").each(function(n) {
                idString += this.id + '|';
            });

            $.post('CustomPostHandler.aspx?step=criteria', { 
                selected: idString
            },
                function(data) {
                    alert(data);
                });
        });

The post handler page does receive the idString variable fine, after some processing it attempts to write back a response:
        // Return dummy response to caller
        Response.Clear();
        Response.ContentType = "text/plain";
        Response.Write("success");
        Response.End();

I've checked the deployment server environment and don't see anything missing (this is running against the 3.5 SP1 framework). Anyone have any ideas or am I missing something?


The problem is probably due to caching.
Try adding a random number to the post URL
$.post('CustomPostHandler.aspx?step=criteria&random=' + Math.random().toString(), { 
            selected: idString
        },


I agree that is probably due to caching. The more general $.ajax function allows you to set the cache option to false in order to disable caching.
Have a look at the documentation.
