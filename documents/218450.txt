Loading custom framework in iPhone
iphone cocoa-touch
I'm trying to use an external framework for UPnP browsing on the iPhone. The framework works perfectly on the Mac, But when I copy it to the iPhone app, it wouldn't run even if there's no code using the framework yet. 
It gives weird error that I can't understand.

Dynamic linking of any kind is not supported on the iPhone. I think the fact you're trying to do dynamic linking is confusing the simulator's careful library loading thingamagig (which if I'm not mistaken it's the source of the errors above).
If the license allows this, link the external UPnP code statically into your app instead.
