Visual Studio variable declaration
visual-studio
I have a project that has the following line in the additional includes section:
"$(SOMEPATH_SHORTNAME)\include"
Can someone tell me where I can find $(SOMEPATH) defined? I can't find it by simply searching in Visual Studio


Check your environment variables.

If it's not an environment variable, the place to look is the macros.  In the property sheets, click the (...) button beside the "Addition Include Directories" line, and expand the "Macros>>" button in the dialog that pops up.  


Right-click My Computer, and then click Properties.
Click the Advanced tab.
Click Environment variables.
Click one the following options, for either a user or a system variable:
Click New to add a new variable name and value.
Click an existing variable, and then click Edit to change its name or value.
