What is a simple command line program or script to backup SQL server databases?
sql-server command-line scripting backup
I've been too lax with performing DB backups on our internal servers. 
Is there a simple command line program that I can use to backup certain databases in SQL Server 2005? Or is there a simple VBScript? 


Schedule the following to backup all Databases:
Use Master

Declare @ToExecute VarChar(8000)

Select @ToExecute = Coalesce(@ToExecute + 'Backup Database ' + [Name] + ' To Disk =     ''D:\Backups\Databases\' + [Name]   + '.bak'' With Format;' + char(13),'')
From
Master..Sysdatabases
Where
[Name] Not In ('tempdb')
and databasepropertyex ([Name],'Status') = 'online'

Execute(@ToExecute)

There are also more details on my blog: how to Automate SQL Server Express Backups.

If you can find the DB files... "cp DBFiles backup/"
Almost for sure not advisable in most cases, but it's simple as all getup.

To backup a single database from the command line, use osql or sqlcmd.
"C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\90\Tools\Binn\osql.exe" 
    -E -Q "BACKUP DATABASE mydatabase TO DISK='C:\tmp\db.bak' WITH FORMAT"

You'll also want to read the documentation on BACKUP and RESTORE and general procedures.

I use ExpressMaint.
To backup all user databases I do for example:
C:>ExpressMaint.exe -S (local)\sqlexpress -D ALL_USER -T DB -BU HOURS -BV 1 -B c:\backupdir\ -DS

I'm using tsql on a Linux/UNIX infrastructure to access MSSQL databases. Here's a simple shell script to dump a table to a file:
#!/usr/bin/ksh
#
#.....
(
tsql -S {database} -U {user} -P {password} <<EOF
select * from {table}
go
quit
EOF
) >{output_file.dump}


I found this on a Microsoft Support page http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2019698.  
It works great!  And since it came from Microsoft, I feel like it's pretty legit.
Basically there are two steps.

Create a stored procedure in your master db. See msft link or if it's broken try here: http://pastebin.com/svRLkqnq
Schedule the backup from your task scheduler.  You might want to put into a .bat or .cmd file first and then schedule that file.
sqlcmd -S YOUR_SERVER_NAME\SQLEXPRESS -E -Q "EXEC sp_BackupDatabases @backupLocation='C:\SQL_Backup\', @backupType='F'"  1>c:\SQL_Backup\backup.log            


Obviously replace YOUR_SERVER_NAME with your computer name or optionally try .\SQLEXPRESS and make sure the backup folder exists.  In this case it's trying to put it into c:\SQL_Backup

Eventual if you don't have a trusted connection as the âE switch declares 
Use following command line
"[program dir]\[sql server version]\Tools\Binn\osql.exe" -Q "BACKUP DATABASE mydatabase TO DISK='C:\tmp\db.bak'" -S [server] âU [login id] -P [password]
Where
[program dir] is the directory where the osql.exe exists
On 32bit OS c:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\
On 64bit OS c:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SQL Server\
[sql server version] your sql server version 110 or 100 or 90 or 80 begin with the largest number
[server] your servername or server ip
[login id] your ms-sql server user login name
[password] the required login password

Below is the simple script to make database backup.
DECLARE @name VARCHAR(50) -- database name  
DECLARE @path VARCHAR(256) -- path for backup files  
DECLARE @fileName VARCHAR(256) -- filename for backup  
DECLARE @fileDate VARCHAR(20) -- used for file name


-- specify database backup directory
SET @path = 'C:\Backup\'  


-- specify filename format
SELECT @fileDate = CONVERT(VARCHAR(20),GETDATE(),112) 


DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR FOR  
SELECT name 
FROM master.dbo.sysdatabases 
WHERE name NOT IN ('master','model','msdb','tempdb')  -- exclude these databases


OPEN db_cursor   
FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name   


WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0   
BEGIN   
       SET @fileName = @path + @name + '_' + @fileDate + '.BAK'  
       BACKUP DATABASE @name TO DISK = @fileName  


       FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name   
END   


CLOSE db_cursor   
DEALLOCATE db_cursor
