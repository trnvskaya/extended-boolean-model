What is the possible mimetype hierachy of an email message?
email mime-types html-email email-integration email-validation
I'm working with a snippet of code that recursively calls itself and tries to pull out a MIME Type part of text/html from an email (if it exists) for further processing.
The "text/html" could exist inside other content such as multipart/alternative, so I'm trying to find out if there is a defined hierarchy for email MIME Types.
Anybody know if there is and what it is? i.e. what types can parent other types?


Your question assumes that mail clients follow the RFC standards for MIME encoding, which they don't. I'd advise you collect a bunch of mail from sources and try and process it as-it-exists. The problem you are facing is extremely difficult (perhaps impossible) to solve 100%.

In theory, only multipart/ and message/ can parent other types (per RFC2046).
