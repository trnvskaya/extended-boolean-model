C++ testing framework: recommendation sought
c++ windows unit-testing frameworks
I'm looking for a "quick and dirty" C++ testing framework I can use on my Windows/Visual Studio box. It's just me developing, so it doesn't have to be enterprise class software. 
Staring at a list of testing frameworks, I am somewhat befuddled...

I have used both UnitTest++ and Boost.Test. They are both easy to setup and use.
Although, I wouldn't use Boost.Test if you're not already using the Boost libraries. It's a bit much to install all of Boost just to get the testing framework.

Great question! There have already been a few questions that address
A few:

Unit testing for C++ code - Tools and methodology
C++ unit testing framework
Unit Testing C Code


Here's a great article about C++ TDD frameworks.  For the record, my personal preference is CxxTest, which I have been happily using for about six months now.

To get a bare bones testing suite going, I recommend the include-only "Fructose". It is especially neat if you want your tests to run on platforms where text output requires calling non-standard APIs (think gaming consoles, embedded devices etc.)

Also take a look at googletest, Google's C++ test framework.

I use UnitTest++ and AMOP for the Mock objects.
However now I would take a long hard look at GoogleTest and GoogleMock as they would probably complement each other quite well.

Have a look at CUnitWin32. It includes an example.
