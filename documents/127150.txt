QTP_errObject CaptureBitmap
testing qa qtp
May I request you to clarify the issue I have with QTP err object.
I am trying to capture the screen shot of an object on which error occured.
I use the code object.captureBitmap(filename) to achieve this.
I would like to know if it is possible to get the screen shot of the entire page with the err object higlighted.


You can get this in your results file.  go to tools->options and select the run tab.  Check the box "Save still image captures to results" and select either always or for errors.  When you run your test it will show the full screen and highlight the object it has a problem with, if it could find it.

(if I'm not too late with my reply)
Use CaptureBitmap method for both problem object and parent of the object.
Then you can display it in a variety of ways using simple html page automatically generated.
