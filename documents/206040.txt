Any good team-chat websites?
python collaboration instant-messaging
Are there any good team-chat websites, preferably in Python, ideally with CherryPy or Trac?
This is similar to http://stackoverflow.com/questions/46612/whats-a-good-freeware-collaborative-ie-multiuser-instant-messenger#46660, but a few primary differences:
1) I very much want to host the server.
2) I don't care if Smileys are included or not in the client.
3) I'd like two options for the users:
   a) Ability to host a private IRC like chat on my Trac page (or link to such a page),
   b) allow remote clients to also interact.  


Campfire from 37 signals - the rails guys.
Edit: It doesn't meet your requirements but it has some great features...
