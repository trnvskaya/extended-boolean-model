Where can I find open source 2d bin packing algorithms?
c++ algorithm bin-packing
I'm looking for open source (preferably c++) algorithms for 2d bin packing of rectangular and or irregular shapes. I've found several papers on the subject but no code.


Here is the best to my knowledge about rectangular bin packing:
