How to get On Focus CWindow handle?
visual-c++ mfc
Is there any way to get the handle to the control that has focus?
I am looking for a way to get the ID of control on focus in my app. 
After that it would be easy to get the id with GetDlgCtrlID.
CWnd *pwnd = GetWindowOnFocus(); 
int wID = pwnd->GetDlgCtrlID();

It's the GetWindowOnFocus part that I am missing!


Have a look at the static CWnd::GetFocus method.
