Detect a âError: Object doesn't support this property or methodâ
vbscript error-handling
The object Iâm working on is instantiated in JavaScript, but used in VBScript. In one code path, the variable M.DOM.IPt is defined and has a value, in the other however it is not. I need to detect if it has been defined or not. I checked that M.DOM is defined and accessable in both code paths. Every test I have tried simply results in this error:

Error: Object doesn't support this property or method

I have tried:

IsEmpty(M.DOM.IPt)
M.DOM.IPt is Nothing
isNull(M.DOM.IPt)

Is there any way to detect the variable isnât defined and avoid the error?
Note: I can put On Error Resume Next in and it will simply ignore the error, but I actually need to detect it and conditionally do something about it.


Have you tried On Error Goto label?

On Error Resume Next
Err.Clear
MyVariable=M.DOM.Ipt
If Err.Number<> 0 Then
    'error occured - Ipt not defined
    'do your processing here
Else
    'no error - Ipt is defined
    'do your processing here
End If



    Function SupportsMember(object, memberName)
      On Error Resume Next

      Dim x
      Eval("x = object."+memberName)

      If Err = 438 Then 
        SupportsMember = False
      Else 
        SupportsMember = True
      End If

      On Error Goto 0 'clears error
    End Function
