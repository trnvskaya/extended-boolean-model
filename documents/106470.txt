Changing the default settings for a console application
c++ visual-studio vc6
I would prefer that a console app would default to 
multithreaded debug.
warning level 4.
build browse information.
no resource folder.
Does anyone know of any technique that would allow me to create a console app, with my desired options, without manually setting it.


Yes, you can do that. What you want is to create your own project template. You can then select that template from the New Project wizard. I wasn't able to location documentation on how to create a project template in Visual Studio 6, but this MSDN article explains the procedure for Visual Studio 2005. Hopefully you will find those instructions to sufficiently similar.

I have concluded this is impossible.
The is support for custom appwizards for windows projects, but not console projectcs.
This is where I did research.

The custom appwizard will accept windows projects as a base for the template, but not console projects.   A message dialog appears that claims that the base project selected is not a c++ project.

This turns out to be fairly easy to do.
Create a new console project in your workspace, name it 0_console
Set its characteristics the way you want them to be. (warning level 4 ...)
get out of msvc, and use windows explorer to copy the project directory.
paste it in at the same directory level as the 0_console project.
rename it to be what ever you want the new project to be.
go into that directory, and edit the dsp file, and replace the 0_console values 
by the new name.
save that, and go into msvc, and simply insert the project into the work space
