Pulling data out of quotes?
c# regex
I'm looking for a regex that can pull out quoted sections in a string, both single and double quotes.
IE:
"This is 'an example', \"of an input string\""

Matches:

an example
of an input string

I wrote up this:
 [\"|'][A-Za-z0-9\\W]+[\"|']

It works but does anyone see any flaws with it?
EDIT: The main issue I see is that it can't handle nested quotes.


It works but doesn't match other characters in quotes (e.g., non-alphanumeric, like binary or foreign language chars). How about this:
[\"']([^\"']*)[\"']

My C# regex is a little rusty so go easy on me if that's not exactly right :)

Like that?
"([\"'])(.*?)\1"

Your desired match would be in sub group 2, and the kind of quote in group one.
The flaw in your regex is 1) the greedy "+" and 2) [A-Za-z0-9] is not really matching an awful lot. Many characters are not in that range.

How does it handle single quotes inside of double quotes (or vice versa)?
"This is 'an example', \"of 'quotes within quotes'\""

should match

an example
of 'quotes within quotes'

Use a backreference if you need to support this.
(\"|')[A-Za-z0-9\\W]+?\1

EDIT:  Fixed to use a reluctant quantifier.

@"(\"|')(.*?)\1"


You might already have one of these, but, in case not, here's a free, open source tool I use all the time to test my regular expressions.  I typically have the general idea of what the expression should look like, but need to fiddle around with some of the particulars.
