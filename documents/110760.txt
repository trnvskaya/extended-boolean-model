Report generation
python report
I am writing a web app using TurboGears, and in that app the users must be able to generate different reports.
The data the reports need is stored in a database (MySQL).
The reports must be returned either as a easily printable html document, or a pdf file.
I have previously used jasper and iReport for creating the documents, but if I can avoid having to fire up Java to create the report I would be happy.
Ideally I would like to specify reports in a easily readable markup language and then just feed the template data with some kind of library that produces the report.
I gladly accept any kind of hints on how I should go about generating these reports!


A partial answer: the easily readable format you are looking for might be DocBook. From there it is very easy to go to PDF, html, RTF, etc. etc.

You can build some fancy PDFs from Python with the ReportLab toolkit.

Pod is my favorite solution to your problem.
