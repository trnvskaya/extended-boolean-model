How to set property to Guid in aspx page
c# asp.net
I have the following code in one of my aspx pages:
<% foreach (Dependency dep in this.Common.GetDependencies(this.Request.QueryString["Name"]))
   { %>
        <ctl:DependencyEditor DependencyKey='<%= dep.Key %>' runat="server" />
<% } %>

When I run it, I get the following error: Parser Error Message: Cannot create an object of type 'System.Guid' from its string representation '<%= dep.Key %>' for the 'DependencyKey' property.
Is there any way that I can create a control and pass in a Guid in the aspx page? I'd really hate to have to loop through and create these controls in the code behind just because of that...
NOTE: The Key property on the Dependency object is a Guid.


The key property of the Dependency object may be a Guid, but is the DependencyKey Property of the DependencyEditor a Guid too? If not it should be, otherwise the correct TypeConverter won't be invoked upon assignment. 
If I'm not mistaken, you could also use dep.Key.ToString() also.

is your control taking the value and assuming its a GUID? Have you tried instantiating a GUID with the value? Looks like this is a cast problem

ok, here's the deal...try using the # symbol instead of the = symbol. I replicated your problem and that gets past the compile issue.
It should look like this "<%# dep.Key %>"
good luck!

Assuming dep.Key is a string representation of a guid... and DependencyKey is a property of type Guid
    <ctl:DependencyEditor DependencyKey="<%= new Guid(dep.Key) %>" runat="server" />
