How to quickly parse a list of strings
python
If I want to split a list of words separated by a delimiter character, I can use
>>> 'abc,foo,bar'.split(',')
['abc', 'foo', 'bar']

But how to easily and quickly do the same thing if I also want to handle quoted-strings which can contain the delimiter character ?
In: 'abc,"a string, with a comma","another, one"'
Out: ['abc', 'a string, with a comma', 'another, one']

The CSV module should be able to do that for you

import csv

input = ['abc,"a string, with a comma","another, one"']
parser = csv.reader(input)

for fields in parser:
  for i,f in enumerate(fields):
    print i,f    # in Python 3 and up, print is a function; use: print(i,f)

Result:

0 abc
1 a string, with a comma
2 another, one
