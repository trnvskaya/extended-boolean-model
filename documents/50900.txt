Best way to detect a release build from a debug build? .net
.net debugging release
So I have about 10 short css files that I use with mvc app.
There are like
error.css
login.css
etc...
Just some really short css files that make updating and editing easy (At least for me). What I want is something that will optimize the if else branch and not incorporate it within the final bits. I want to do something like this
if(Debug.Mode){

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="error.css" /> 
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="login.css" /> 
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="menu.css" /> 
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="page.css" /> 
} else {
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="site.css" /> 
}

I'll have a msbuild task that will combine all the css files, minimize them and all that good stuff. I just need to know if there is a way to remove the if else branch in the final bits.


I should had used google.
#if DEBUG
    Console.WriteLine("Debug mode.") 
#else 
    Console.WriteLine("Release mode.") 
#endif 

Make sure that the option "Configuration settings" -> "Build" "Define DEBUG 
constant" in the project properties is checked. 

Compiler constants. I don't remember the C# syntax, but this is how I do it in VB:
#If CONFIG = "Debug" Then
  'do somtehing
#Else
  'do something else
#EndIf


Specifically, like this in C#:
#if (DEBUG)
   Debug Stuff
#endif

C# has the following preprocessor directives:
#if 
#else 
#elif // Else If
#endif
#define
#undef // Undefine
#warning // Causes the preprocessor to fire warning
#error // Causes the preprocessor to fire a fatal error
#line // Lets the preprocessor know where this source line came from
#region // Codefolding
#endregion


  if (System.Diagnostics.Debugger.IsAttached)
  {
           // Do this
  }
  else
  {
            // Do that
  }


You can try to use 
HttpContext.Current.IsDebuggingEnabled

it is controlled by a   node in configuration. In my opinion this is nicer solution than conditional compilation. 
However if you want to be able to control based on a compilatino I think you can used a ConditionalAttribute.
