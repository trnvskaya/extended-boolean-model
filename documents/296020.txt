How can I lock the first row and first column of a table when scrolling, possibly using JavaScript and CSS?
javascript css excel scroll css-tables
How can I create a table that has its first row and first column both locked, as in Excel, when you activate 'freeze panes'?  I need the table to both scroll horizontally and vertically (a lot of solutions for this exist, but only allow vertical scrolling).
So, when you scroll down in the table, the first row will stay put, since it will have the column headings.  This may end up being in a thead, or it may not, whatever makes the solution easier.
When you scroll right, the first column stays put, since it holds the labels for the rows.
I'm pretty certain this is impossible with CSS alone, but can anyone point me toward a JavaScript solution?  It needs to work in all major browsers.


How about a solution where you put the actual "data" of the table inside its own div, with overflow: scroll;? Then the browser will automatically create scrollbars for the portion of the "table" you do not want to lock, and you can put the "table header"/first row just above that <div>.
Not sure how that would work with scrolling horizontally though.

Sort and Lock Table is the only solution I have seen which does work on other browsers than IE. (although this "locked column css" might do the trick as well)

I ran across a site a few weeks back. This is a working example of the first column locked but it is not browser compatible with Firefox. I didn't do a lot of checking around but it seems it only works in IE. There are some notes the author provided along with it that you can read.
Lock the First column:

Let me know if you need the Javascript to lock the Table headers too.

You'd have to test it but if you embedded an iframe within your page then used CSS to absolutely position the 1st row & column at 0,0 in the iframe page would that solve your problem?

You need two tables, where the first one is an exact overlay over the second one. The second one contains all the data, where the first one just contains the first column. You have to synchronize it's width and depending on the content also the height of it's rows. 
Additional to this two tables, you need a third one. That's the first row, which lays exactly between the other two and has to be synchronized in the same way.
You will need absolute positioning here. Next, you would synchronize the scrolling of the data table with the scrolling positions of the head row and first column table.
That works very well in all major browsers, except for one issue: The synchronized scrolling will flutter. To fix that, you need two outher div containers that hold a clone of the content of the header row and the first column. When scrolling vertically, you display the header row clone to prevent fluttering, while you reposition the original in the background.
When scrolling horizontally, you would show the first row clone. Same thing here.

I've posted my jQuery plugin solution here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/486576/frozen-table-header-inside-scrollable-div/1533619#1533619
It does exactly what you want and is really lightweight and easy to use.

There are quite a few cross browser solutions for this today, among which are SuperTable which I like due to its elegance and simplicity (now being continued with MooGrid) and SlickGrid with its awesome set of features.

Oh well, I looked up for scrollable table with fixed column to understand the need of this specific requirement and your question was one of it with no close answers.. 
I answered this question Large dynamically sized html table with a fixed scroll row and fixed scroll column which inspired to showcase my work as a plugin https://github.com/meetselva/fixed-table-rows-cols
The plugin basically converts a well formatted HTML table to a scrollable table with fixed table header and columns.
The usage is as below,
$('#myTable').fxdHdrCol({
    fixedCols    : 3,       /* 3 fixed columns */
    width        : "100%",  /* set the width of the container (fixed or percentage)*/
    height       : 500      /* set the height of the container */
});

You can check the demo and documentation here

I did this with a combination of: 

Using multiple tables
Fixed-size cells
jQuery's scrollTop and scrollLeft functions

Here's a jsfiddle example to demonstrate. 
Haven't tested on all browsers but I imagine it's not great on older IE versions.
jQuery
$("#clscroll-content").scroll(function() {
    $("#clscroll-row-headers").scrollTop($("#clscroll-content").scrollTop());
    $("#clscroll-column-headers").scrollLeft($("#clscroll-content").scrollLeft());
});

$("#clscroll-column-headers").scroll(function() {
    $("#clscroll-content").scrollLeft($("#clscroll-column-headers").scrollLeft());
});

$("#clscroll-row-headers").scroll(function() {
    $("#clscroll-content").scrollTop($("#clscroll-row-headers").scrollTop());
});

You can do it, without javascript

Here a plugin JQuery: https://github.com/nitsugario/jQuery-Freeze-Table-Column-and-Rows
This is a jQuery plugin that can make table rows and columns not scroll.  It can take a given HTML table object and set it so it can freeze a given number of columns or rows or both, so the fixed columns or rows do not scroll.  The rows to be frozen should be placed in the table head section.  It can also freeze rows and columns combined with using colspan or rowspan attributes.
