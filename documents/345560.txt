How do I connect to a IBM 3770 Remote Job Entry system for Customs Border Patrol 10+2 Security Filing from Java?
java security ibm file-transfer
I'm working on a project to submit the new 10+2 Security Filing data to Customs & Border Patrol (as required by DHS). Anyone else doing this? I need to be able to submit our data files via a IBM 3770 style Remote Job Entry gateway using Job Control Language and all the old junk. 
Question is this: Is there a Java API that will handle the IBM 3770 aspect? Perhaps I will be building one in this project...
This sooo reminds me of my old COBOL days. Never thought I'd be doing JCL again... 


I thought that CBP had done away with 3770 dial-up altogether.  It is my understanding that everything switched to IBM MQ.  We use MQ to connect to CBP in our business.  Its far simpler and reliable.  You can talk to it via JMS also.
