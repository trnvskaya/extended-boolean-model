An example for using DBMS_AQ.POST and explanation of its utility
oracle messaging advanced-queuing
The DBMS_AQ package has a method called POST. 
The documentation says,

This procedure posts to a list of
  anonymous subscriptions, allowing all
  clients who are registered for the
  subscriptions to get notifications of
  persistent messages. This feature is
  not supported with buffered messages.

and

This call provides a best-effort
  guarantee. A notification goes to
  registered clients at most once. This
  call is primarily used for lightweight
  notification. If an application needs
  more rigid guarantees, then it can
  enqueue to a queue.

I understand all of the words but I do not see a purpose for non-guaranteed messaging. I queue something because I need it to get somewhere. Maybe it's just that my business doesn't have a use-case for this. I'd to know what use-cases you have for such a technology.


The first that springs to mind is that you may have a large number of client applications interested in the DB information. Some system triggers an event that updates the database with useful, but not so important information (e.g. total count of rows in a table that is shown to the user).
It then wants to broadcast this to the clients, but if a client is really busy (or offline briefly - e.g. network disconnect), this approach can be used to drop the unimportant message. This may be the best approach to take in some situations as if they are offline the client may when reconnecting actively look up all the information again.
While there are use cases, I would guess they're much less common than guaranteed delivery - just like TCP seems to be used significantly more than UDP.
