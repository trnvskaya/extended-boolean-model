How to Naturally/Numerically Sort a DataView?
.net asp.net icomparable
I am wondering how to naturally sort a DataView...  I really need help on this.  I found articles out there that can do lists with IComparable, but I need to sort the numbers in my dataview.
They are currently alpha sorted because they are numbers with 'commas' in them.  Please help me out.
I would like to find something instead of spending the time to create it my self.
P.S.  expression and sortdirection work, but they of course Alpha sort.  Please help.


I often like to add a "SortOrder" column to results that I want to sort in a way other than is provided by the data.  I usually use an integer and just add it when I am getting the data.
I don't show this column and only use it for the purposes of establishing the order.
I'm not sure if this is what you are looking for, but it is quick and easy and gives you a great deal of control.
