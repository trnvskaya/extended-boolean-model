I don't want a "close window" menu item in the task bar context menu for my WPF window. My intention is to annoy the user.
Thank you!


Although I don't see a reason to remove the close command from the menu other than to annoy users you can find information how to modify the system menu of an application in C# using WinAPI calls here:

An easier option would be to do this:
<Window ShowInTaskbar="False" ... />
