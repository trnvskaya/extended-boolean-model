How to (de)serialise JSON data in Silverlight using a different name to member variable
.net silverlight json serialization silverlight-2.0
I have the following members defined in a class that I'm trying to deserialise:
[DataMemberAttribute(Name = "cust_title")]
    	public String Title { get; set; }
    	[DataMemberAttribute(Name = "cust_description")]
    	public String Description { get; set; }

For some reason, the deserialisation fails (it seems to ignore the DataMemberAttribute).
Does anyone know how to get this working?


I've just found the answer out by a bit of trial and error. In order to use the [DataMemberAttribute] you must also put [DataContractAttribute] above your class definition:
[DataContractAttribute]
public class MyClass
{
  [DataMemberAttribute(Name="test_test")]
  public String Test { get; set; }
}
