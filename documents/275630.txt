Excel: 'Unable to set the Calculation property of the Application class'
excel
I'm trying to automate some stuff in MS Excel. When I try to set the Calculation property I get the following error message: 'Unable to set the Calculation property of the Application class'
I believe this property should be settable.
Any advice appreciated!


Make sure you are setting it to a proper value.
 Application.Calculation = xlCalculationManual

or one of the following values:
xlCalculationAutomatic: Excel controls recalculation. 
xlCalculationManual: Calculation is done when the user requests it. 
xlCalculationSemiautomatic: Excel controls recalculation but ignores changes in tables. 

Googling produces this suggestion:
You need to have a open workbook, ie
xl.Workbooks.Add
xl.Calculation = xlCalculationManual
