Markdown and image alignment
html css markdown
I'm helping out a friend with a non-profit site that publishes articles in issues each month. They are mostly straightforward, and I think using a markdown editor (like the wmd one here in SO) would be perfect. However, they do need the ability to have images right-aligned in a given paragraph. I can't see any way to do that with the current system - is it possible?


You can embed HTML in Markdown, so you can do something like this:
<img style="float: right;" src="whatever.jpg">

Continue markdown text...


<div style="float:left;margin:0 10px 10px 0" markdown="1">
    ![book](/images/book01.jpg)
</div>

The attribute markdown possibility inside markdown.

Even cleaner would be to just put p#given img { float: right } in the style sheet, or in the <head> and wrapped in style tags. Then, just use the markdown ![Alt text](/path/to/img.jpg).

Embedding CSS is bad:
![Flowers](/flowers.jpeg)

CSS in another file:
img[alt=Flowers] { float: right; }


Simplest is to wrap the image in a center tag, like so ...
<center>![Alt test](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/bc/Wiki.png)</center>

Anything to do with Markdown can be tested here - http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus
Sure, <center> may be deprecated, but it's simple and it works!

I like to be super lazy by using tables to align images with the vertical pipe (|) syntax. This is supported by some markdown flavours (and is also supported by textile if that floats your boat)
| I am text to the left  | ![Flowers](/flowers.jpeg) |

or 
| ![Flowers](/flowers.jpeg) | I am text to the right |

Not the most flexible solution, but it is good for most of my simple needs, is easy to read in markdown format, and you don't need to remember any CSS or raw HTML.

Many Markdown "extra" processors support attributes. So you can include a class name like so (PHP Markdown Extra):
![Flowers](/flowers.jpeg){.callout}

or, alternatively (Kramdown):
![Flowers](/flowers.jpeg){: .callout}

Then, of course, you can use a stylesheet the proper way:

.callout {
    float: right;
}

If yours supports this syntax, it gives you the best of both worlds: no embedded markup, and a stylesheet abstract enough to not need to be modified by your content editor.

As greg said you can embed html in markdown.. but one of the points of markdown is to avoid having to have extensive (or any, for that matter) css/html markup knowledge right? This is what I do:
in my markdown file I simply instruct all my wiki editors to embed wrap all images with something that looks like this 
'<div> // put image here  </div>`

(of course.. they donno what <div> means but that shouldn't matter)
so the markdown file looks like this:
<div>
![optional img description][1]
</div>

[1]: /image/path

and in the css that wraps the whole page I can do whatever I want with the image tag: 
img {
   float: right;
}

of course you can do more with the css.. (in this particular case, wrapping the img with div prevents other text from wrapping against the image.. this is just an example though) but IMHO the point of markdown is that you don't want potentially non-technical people getting into the ins and outs of css/html.. it's up to you as a web-dev to make your css that wraps the page as generic and clean as possible, but then again your editors need not know about that.

If you implement it in Python, there is an extension that lets you add html key/value pairs, and class/id labels. The syntax is for this is:
![A picture of a cat](cat.png){: style="float:right"}

Or, if embedded styling doesn't float your boat,
![A picture of a cat](cat.png){: .floatright}

with corresponding stylesheet stylish.css:
.floatright {
    float: right;
    /* etc. */
}


I liked learnvst's answer of using the tables because it is quite readable (which is one purpose of writing Markdown).
However, in the case of GitBook's Markdown parser I had to, in addition to an empty header line, add a separator line under it, for the table to be recognized and properly rendered:
| - | - |
|---|---|
| I am text to the left  | ![Flowers](/flowers.jpeg) |
| ![Flowers](/flowers.jpeg) | I am text to the right |

Separator lines need to include at least three dashes --- .

I am found nice solution in pure Markdown with a little CSS3 hack :-)
![image alt >](/image-right.jpg)
![image alt <](/image-left.jpg)
![image alt <>](/center-image.jpg)

Follow CSS3 code float image on left or right, when image alt ends with < or >. 
img[alt$=">"] {
  float:right;
}

img[alt$="<"] {
  float:left;
}

img[alt$="<>"] {
    display: block;
    max-width: 100%;
    height: auto;
    margin: auto;
    float: none!important;
}
