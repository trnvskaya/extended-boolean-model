Trim whitespace from middle of string
regex parsing
I'm using the following regex to capture a fixed width "description" field that is always 50 characters long:
(?.{50})

My problem is that the descriptions sometimes contain a lot of whitespace, e.g.
"FLUID        COMPRESSOR                          "

Can somebody provide a regex that:

Trims all whitespace off the end
Collapses any whitespace in between words to a single space



Is there a particular reason you are asking for a regular expression? They may not be the best tool for this task.
A replacement like 
 s/[ \t]+/ /g

should compress the internal whitespace (actually, it will compress leading and trailing whitespace too, but it doesn't sound like that is a problem.), and 
s/[ \t]+$/$/

will take care of the trailing whitespace. [I'm using sedish syntax here. You didn't say what flavor you prefer.]

Right off hand I don't see a way to do it in a single expression.

Substitute two or more spaces for one space:
s/  +/ /g

Edit: for any white space (not just spaces) you can use \s if you're using a perl-compatible regex library, and the curly brace syntax for number of occurrences, e.g.
s/\s\s+/ /g

or
s/\s{2,}/ /g

Edit #2: forgot the /g global suffix, thanks JL

Perl-variants:
1) s/\s+$//;
2) s/\s+/ /g;

str = Regex.Replace(str, " +( |$)", "$1");


Since compressing whitespace and trimming whitespace around the edges are conceptually different operations, I like doing it in two steps:
re.replace("s/\s+/ /g", str.strip())

Not the most efficient, but quite readable.

/(^[\s\t]+|[\s\t]+([\s\t]|$))/g replace with $2 (beginning|middle/end)

C#:
Only if you wanna trim all the white spaces - at the start, end and middle.
     string x = Regex.Replace(x, @"\s+", " ").Trim();
