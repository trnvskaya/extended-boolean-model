Can you use SIMBL to develop a plug-in for the iPhone's Safari?


No, you cannot.

As is clear in Apple's terms of use with the iPhone SDK, no non-native code can be run by any application. This means, among other things NO PLUGINS. At all. Not for Safari, not for your own application.

For devices that have Cydia, you can build a MobileSubstrate plugin. An example of such a plugin is DHowett's Safari Download Manager.

You could also create a Safari webplugin, which loads a custom UIView to display content based on MIME types.
