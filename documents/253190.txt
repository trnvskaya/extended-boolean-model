pl give vb code for custom paging and sorting in asp:repeater using stored procedure


Here is step one and two from 4guys that gives a very clear explanation along with zip download available of all code in VB and sample t-sql too.  
It deals with ObjectDataSource  from which then it should be straigtforward enough to bind your repeater to.

You're going to need to give a little bit more information than just that. If you're using ASP.NEt 1.x, the code will be a whole lot different to that for ASP.NET 2.0 or higher. Indeed, what do you mean by 'custom' paging and sorting? You could use VS to create a DataSource that calls the stored procedure and does the paging and sorting for you and then bind the datasource control to the repeater.
