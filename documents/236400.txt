Any Smalltalk on .NET?
.net smalltalk
Are there any usable implementations of Smalltalk for the .NET runtime?


There's a project to build Smalltalk on top of the DLR. Unsurprisingly, it's called IronSmaltalk.

There was Vista Smalltalk, but the project writer seems to have disappeared. It was making good progress, so perhaps one day... http://vistasmalltalk.wordpress.com/

Todor Todorov gave a presentation on IronSmalltalk at the ESUG conference in Edinburgh last week. 

There is LSW Vision-Smalltalk, which seems to be a private Smalltalk environment, they claim to support .NET:
"LSWVST has a .NET Integration which enables us to develop our .NET Tools. LSWVST includes now LSW DotNet-Lab a toolset for .NET programmiing. We have created a "pure .NET experimental Smalltalk ( LSWVST.Net )."
you may have to ask privately for a downloadable copy.
