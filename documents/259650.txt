Is there danger of corruption in SQL Server 2000 databases when using SQL Server 2005 Management Studio?
sql sql-server ssms enterprise-manager
In an interview for a SQL DBA position a while back, I mentioned I prefer the SQL 2005 Management Studio app vs. the old 2000 versions of Enterprise Manager / Query Analyzer. The DBA who was interviewing me said that they had experienced some sort of database corruption in their 2000 databases when making changes from the 2005 MS, so they always use Enterprise Manager now. 
He was a bit vague, but I got the impression he was talking about some sort of corruption experienced when making server-wide or database-level setting changes, and not just routine SQL updates or something.
Anyone heard of anything like this? I didn't end up taking that position, so I can't follow up to get more info.


Sounds like he was just was using that as an excuse for lack of experience with SQL 2005 Management Studio.  DBA's hate change.  lol.

I have never encountered this, in almost three years of using SQL Management Studio 2005 to manage SQL 2000 databases. There are a few tasks I still bounce back into EntMan for, but I've never had a database encounter even the minutest bit of corruption. (And background: As a consultant, I'm managing about 45 different databases for both client and internal projects; most are heavily hit, and only about a dozen are SQL2005 databases.)
