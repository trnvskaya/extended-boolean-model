Shortcut for commenting CSS in VS 2008
css visual-studio
When I press the standard Ctrl + E, C (an other variants) in VS2008 whilst editing a CSS file, it says that command is not available. How do I setup a shortcut to apply a plain old /* */ comment to selected text in VS? Thanks


Within Visual Studio, hit Alt-F11 to open the Macro IDE and add a new module by right-clicking on MyMacros and selecting Add|Add Module...
Paste the following in the source editor:
Imports System
Imports EnvDTE
Imports EnvDTE80
Imports EnvDTE90
Imports System.Diagnostics

Public Module CommentCSS
    Sub CommentCSS()
        Dim selection As TextSelection
        selection = DTE.ActiveDocument.Selection

        Dim selectedText As String
        selectedText = selection.Text

        If selectedText.Length > 0 Then
            selection.Text = "/*" + selectedText + "*/"
        End If
    End Sub
End Module

You can create a keyboard shortcut by going to Tools|Options... and selecting Keyboard under the Environment section in the navigation on the left.  Select your macro and assign any shortcut you like.  
You can also add your macro to a menu or toolbar by going to Tools|Customize... and selecting the Macros section in the navigation on the left.  Once you locate your macro in the list, you can drag it to any menu or toolbar, where it its text or icon can be customized to whatever you want.

here's an even simpler solution:
Sub CommentCSS()
    DTE.ActiveDocument.Selection.StartOfLine(VsStartOfLineOptions.VsStartOfLineOptionsFirstText)
    DTE.ActiveDocument.Selection.Text = "/*"
    DTE.ActiveDocument.Selection.EndOfLine()
    DTE.ActiveDocument.Selection.Text = "*/"
End Sub

you can record it yourself using ctrl+shift+R

place the cursor on the line you want to comment
press "Home" on your keyboard
type /*
press "End" on your keyboard
type */
save your recording
