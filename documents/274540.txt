How to publish our Webservices
asp.net web-services
I have created an web service I need to publish this service. I need to host and authenticated users need to access my services using ASP.net 2.0


I'm not sure if you are asking for an alternative, but I've been experimenting with this code that seems to work well on codeproject.com (CP).

If your question is on security, perhaps this article on CP is a useful start.
