RegEx to replace value including new lines
c# regex
I have a snippet looking something like the below.
string bodyTypeAssemblyQualifiedName = "XXX.XX.XI.CustomerPayment.Schemas.r1.CustomerPayments_v01, XXX.XX.XI.CustomerPaym" +
                "ent.Schemas.r1, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=ac564f277cd4488" +
                "e";

I'd like use regular expression in C# to get it to: 
string bodyTypeAssemblyQualifiedName = null;

I've tried using a RegEx like the below but it doesn't match the newlines ...
bodyTypeAssemblyQualifiedName\s=\s(?<location>.*?);



You can try
bodyTypeAssemblyQualifiedName\s=\s(?<location>[.\n]*?);

Or you set the RegexOptions.Singleline for your pattern.

RegexOptions.Singleline - Specifies single-line mode. Changes the meaning of the dot (.) so it matches every character (instead of every character except \n). 


This works:

(?<=string\sbodyTypeAssemblyQualifiedName\s=\s)(?s:[^;]*)(?=;)

Which is the equivalent of:

After the string "string
bodyTypeAssemblyQualifiedName = "
Turn on single line (treat \r\n as
any other character) ( this is what
(?s: ) does)
match every character that is not a semicolon
until a single semicolon is reached


@Will, by replacing the dot with a negated character class, you eliminated the need for the single-line modifier.  And if I'm reading the question right, you don't need to use lookarounds either.
bodyTypeAssemblyQualifiedName\s+=\s+(?<location>[^;]+);
