How do I pass a string parameter greater than varchar(8000) in SQL Server 2000?
sql-server tsql parameters
You get a compilation error if you define the string parameter to have a size greater than 8000
e.g. 
The size (9000) given to the type 'varchar' exceeds the maximum allowed for any data type (8000).

Any ideas?


you need to store it as TEXT instead of varchar for string larger than 8000 in sql 2000

You can't do that in SQL 2000, use the "text" data type instead.
Choose SQL 2000 Data Types

You can't use text as a parameter value for a stored proc in SQL 2000, so usually the technique is to break up the information into chunks of 8000 characters or less and reassemble in the proc.

    Sure you can.


What you cannot do is define a local variable as text
