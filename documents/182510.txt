What is the best PHP lib/class to generate RSS/Atom
php rss atom rdf
I have to produce RSS/Atom feed in various applications, and I want to know a good lib/class wich is able to produce both, and which already handle all common problems.
For example the one I used for year does not put the right format for date, so my feed is not well handled by several aggregators.
Thanks, 
CÃ©dric
Update : 
Why I am looking for a lib? Because the one I used for years, which I had hacked a few, have a little problem. Maybe a specification is not correctly followed.

Do you really need a library? Choose format and simply follow its specification to output valid XML.
Here is some tutorial to get started.

Hmmm, IMO, unless you want enclosures, both of these formats are easy enough to craft without any classes. E.g. for the RSS feeds of a website that I administrate, I simply wrote a small Smarty template, and it works pretty smoothly.

The PHP Universal Feed Generator seems to be exactly what you're after - it has a simple, OO-based way of declaring a new feed and outputting it to your desired specification. 
It also has built-in date format conversions as one of it's features.

Features:

Generates RSS 1.0, RSS 2.0 and ATOM 1.0 feeds
All feeds are are validated by feed validator.
Implements appropriate namespaces for different versions.
Automatically converts date formats.
Generates UUID for ATOM feeds.
Handles CDATA encoding for required tags.

Supported versions:

RSS 1.0 (which officially obsoleted RSS 0.90)
RSS 2.0 (which officially obsoleted RSS 0.91, 0.92, 0.93 and 0.94)
ATOM 1.0



PHP Universal Feed Generator is a good answer. I had just to modify the code accordingly to a comment on the webpage to handle correcly french characters.

Like Kereste says (1. June) FeedWrite
  makes problems with some none-english
  utf-8 characters like Ã¤ etc.. this is
  because xml only knows 5 entities
  (&,â,â,). So I changed line 298 in the
  source code into
$nodeText .= (in_array($tagName,
  $this->CDATAEncoding))? $tagContent :
  str_replace ( array ( â&â, âââ, âââ, â
  ), array ( â&â , â"â, â'â , â<â , â>â
  ), $tagContent);
to avoiod converting charakters into
  wrong xml entities.


For non-english charsets take a look at the PHP function htmlentities:
http://php.net/manual/en/function.htmlentities.php
I've just added to support croatian charset:
$nodeText .= (in_array($tagName, $this->CDATAEncoding))? $tagContent : htmlentities($tagContent, ENT_COMPAT, 'UTF-8');
