MySQL search and replace some text in a field
mysql
What MySQL query will do a text search and replace in one particular field in a table?
ie search for 'foo' and replace with 'bar' so a record with a field with the value : 'hello foo' becomes: 'hello bar'.


The Replace string function will do that.


UPDATE table_name 
SET field = replace(field, '[string-to-find]', '[string-that-will-replace-it]');

Change table_name and field to match your table name and field in question:
UPDATE table_name SET field = REPLACE(field, 'foo', 'bar') WHERE INSTR(field, 'foo') > 0;


And if you want to search and replace based on the value of another field you could do a CONCAT:
update table_name set `field_name` = replace(`field_name`,'YOUR_OLD_STRING',CONCAT('NEW_STRING',`OTHER_FIELD_VALUE`,'AFTER_IF_NEEDED'));

Just to have this one here so that others will find it at once.

 UPDATE table SET field = replace(field, text_needs_to_be_replaced, text_required);

Like for example, if I want to replace all occurrences of John by Mark I will use below, 
UPDATE student SET student_name = replace(student_name, 'John', 'Mark');


I used the above command line as follow:
update TABLE-NAME set FIELD = replace(FIELD, 'And', 'and');
the purpose was to replace And with and ("A" should be lowercase). The problem is it cannot find the "And" in database, but if I use like "%And%" then it can find it along with many other ands that are part of a word or even the ones that are already lowercase.
