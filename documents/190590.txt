Does Ruby have a built-in do ... while?
ruby conditional keyword
Ruby has a wealth of conditional constructs, including if/unless, while/until etc.
The while block from C:
while (condition) {
    ...
}

can be directly translated to Ruby:
while condition 
    ...
end

However, I can't seem to find a built-in equivalent in Ruby for a C-like do ... while block in which the block contents are executed at least once:
do { 
    ... 
} while (condition);

Any suggestions?


...The best I could come up with is the loop construct with a break at the end: 
loop do
    ...
    break unless condition
end


You can use
while condition
  ...
end


You can do
i=1
begin
  ...
  i+=1 
end until 10==x

(you can also tack on a while clause to the end of begin..end)
see p 128 of Flanagan/Matz Ruby Prog'g Lang book: This is something that may be removed in releases after 1.8

number=3
begin
 puts  number
 number-=1
end while number>0
