Automatic newlines and formatting for blogging software
php newline blogs
I'm writing by own blogging engine in PHP with a MYSQL backend database. MY question is: How would you go about making user comments and blog posts include newlines wherever they are appropriate?
For example, if a user hits the return key in the message/comments box how would this translate into a new line that would show in the browser when the comment is viewed?


PHP has a function: nl2br which turns new lines into <br />
www.php.net/nl2br

Replace \n\n with </p><p> and then replace \n with <br>.
PS: Pirate day was last week :).

It's also important what your using for a comment editor.  If your using a standard textbox then yes, nl2br is what your looking for.  If your going a bit more advanced such as using a WYSIWYG editor like tinyMCE, then it has configuration that can handle that for you.

nl2br() (http://php.net/nl2br) is perfectly good, however that Wordpress Guy (Matt Mullenweg) has a really good function, which is a bit more advanced as it converts double line breaks to paragraphs instead (better semantically). You can find it in the Wordpress source code or here: http://ma.tt/scripts/autop/

If you happen to need more formatting options (beyond paragraphs), employ something like Text_Wiki or PHP Markdown.
The advantages would be:

no need to allow HTML and deal with all the filtering (that's good :-))
clear/familiar guide to formatting data
a lot of flexibility when you generate the HTML (in the end for display)

The disadvantages:

no HTML (blessing and curse ;-))
people might not be familiar the syntax
