Style for web application grid
css grid styles
I'm working on a small bugtracking system which shows a list of bugs. For the overview I want to use a grid - now I only need a style. 
Of course I won't copy the whole style from anyone else, but I just want to know which type of styles you like. Do you have any other great style?
What do you think about the styles on this site.
Do you like the Component art grid styles?
What about the styles from telerik?
Thanks for your help


CSS table gallery can be a great source of inspiration.
The CSS Table Gallery is a showcase of how CSS and data tables can work together to create usable and pretty results.
