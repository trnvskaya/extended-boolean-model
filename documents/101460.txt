Is there a way to prevent google search terms from matching urls?
google-search
At the moment, I am doing a number of searches which include "html" in them, for example "html rearrange".  Unfortunately, I get a lot of hits from sites that include "rearrange" on a .html page but have no mention of html in the page itself.
Is there a way to prevent search terms from matching urls?


try something like
"html rearrange -inurl:html"
the inurl means "match the following pattern in the URL", the - means to exclude those pages

-inurl:(htm|html) "search term"
Good luck!

Thanks for the answers - I didn't know about "inurl" - very useful indeed.
I poked about in google and found the list of operators that can be used:
http://www.google.com/help/operators.html.
There are some other ones in there I might find useful too.

you should actually use rearrange intext:html, otherwise you omit all pages ending in .html.
for example, the way matt will include www.somesite.com/rearrange.php but not www.somesite.org/better_result.html.
If www.somesite.org/better_result.html was a better result, then you might miss some important information.
