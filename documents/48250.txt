Free JSP plugin for eclipse?
eclipse jsp
I was looking out for a free plugin for developing/debugging JSP pages in eclipse.
Any suggestions? 


The Eclipse Web Tools Platform Project includes a JSP debugger. I have only ever needed to use it with Tomcat so I cannot say how well it works with other servlet containers.

BEA seems to have a free one BEA JSP plugin - not used it, so not sure how good it is.
Oracle now owns BEA, and they have this plugin which might do a similar job.

The former BEA Workshop is now Oracle Workshop. It is the best JSP editor with WYSIWYG support and it is free. It is not specific to WebLogic. Basic JSP editing is server neutral anyway. However, it supports launching and debugging on many servers.
You can read my blog post about it.
