Dynamically instantiate a Ruby class similar to Java
java ruby
How can this line in Java be translated to Ruby:
    String className = "java.util.Vector";
    ...
    Object o = Class.forName(className).newInstance();  
Thanks!


Object::const_get('String').new()


If you're using ActiveSupport (i.e. Rails), there is a method added to String that does this:
"String".constantize.new
