SQLite .dump command from SQLiteConnection object
c# sqlite
Using SQLite from .net, Is there a way to access the .dump command or something equivalent from the SQLiteConnection class?


The .dump command is part of the sqlite command line program (shell.c), not part of the sqlite library. So, it is unlikely to be provided by a .net connection class. 
However, since the source code for the sqlite command line program is in the public domain, and uses the same library as the .net wrapper, it would be possible to translate the C code for the .dump command to C#. See the function do_meta_command in this file.
