Strategies for Data Loading and DB Initialization for Integration Tests
java database integration-testing
I'm developing an integration testing framework for a data intensive J2EE enterprise application and I'm trying to decide upon a strategy for initializing and populating the database. We have a fairly complex model.
The system will have to:

Initialize the system itself 
Load users 
Load application test data

The test data won't be as complex as the system will handle, load and stress testing is the domain of a specialized test team. We're interested in how well the UI's display what is in the system and that functions integration correctly from top to bottom.


DBUnit is a pretty good framework for loading data into a test database.

Unitils provides support for both loading the test data and keeping the test DB schema up-to-date. In order for the latter to work, your schema change scripts need to follow a particular naming convention.
