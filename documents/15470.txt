How do I get rid of Home in ASP.Net MVC?
asp.net-mvc asp.net-mvc-routing
I know this site is written using ASP.Net MVC and I do not see "/Home" in the url.  This proves to me that it can be done.  What special route and do I need?


Just change "Home" to an empty string.
routes.MapRoute(
    "Home",
    "",
    new { action = Index, controller = Home }
);


If you're running on IIS 7, you can simply delete the Default.aspx file that comes with ASP.NET MVC (assuming you're running on Preview 3 or higher). That file was needed due to an issue with Cassini that was fixed in .NET 3.5 SP1. For more details check out:

I actually like having all of my home controller methods to be at the root of the site. Like this:  /about, /contact, etc.  I guess I'm picky.  I use a simple route constraint to do it.  Here is my blog post with a code sample.

I'd add  
routes.MapRoute("NoIndex", "{action}", new { controller = "Home", action = "Index" });

in RouteConfig.cs

This is what I did to get rid of Home.  It will treat all routes with only one specifier as Home/Action and any with two as Controller/Action.  The downside is now controller has to have an explicit index (/Controller != /Controller/Index), but it might help you or others.
routes.MapRoute(
    "Default",
    "{action}",
    new { controller = "Home", action = "Index" }
);

routes.MapRoute(
    "Actions",
    "{controller}/{action}",
    new { }
);
