Image Slider with Silverlight
silverlight silverlight-2.0
I have a requirement of creating an Image slider using Silverlight. I need to display 5 images at first. There will be two buttons previous and next. When I'll click the next button another new 5 images will be shown in place of previously diplayed images. Would it be possible for anyone to tell me the solution for this? 
Someone please help me.
