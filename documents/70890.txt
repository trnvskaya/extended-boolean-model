Extracting text from a PDF using JBoss Richfaces
java ajax jsf seam richfaces
I am trying to write a web-app to manage references for my PhD thesis.
I used to manage this information inside a personal Confluence (fantastic tool! - http://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/) instance however I'm fed-up with the opening of PDF's and cutting and pasting values into fields that I wish to record.
I have exposed a webservice that will return me images based on a PDF filename and a page number. The same webservice also exposes a method that will return the text inside of a provided rectangle (top left x-y coord, bottom right x-y coord).
I would like to be able to drag a rectangle over part of the PDF image and then call the webservice to give me the text (which I will then store on a EntityBean). I am looking at using the JBoss application stack (Application Server, Hibernate, Seam and Richfaces). Does anybody know how I could go about achieving this? I have seen the ability to draw custom images in other RIA toolkits (e.g. dojo), but I can't see a way of doing this inside of Richfaces.
Hopefully somebody out there could prove me wrong, or provide some idea about what I can do (as I am not a web developer - I'm mainly building this tool because the RIA frameworks available now have got me interested!)
I already have the code to extract the text, my problem is purely how can I get the user to draw a "selection rectangle" inside the web browser over the top of the image?
Many Thanks,
Aidos


Try using the RichFaces Paint 2D tag
It exposes the Graphics2D package to the user interface.
Track user drag events on the image using javascript, then post the co-ordrdinates to the backing bean to re-render the image with a drawn on selection box.

Have you considered Mendeley ? It will try to parse and extract bibliographic information from your pdfs.

you can do it with itext (http://www.lowagie.com/iText/)
