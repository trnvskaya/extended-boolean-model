Postage Calculator for PHP
php shipping cart shopping
Could anyone point me in the right direction for a shipping calculator?  I would like something simple and I don't want to sign up for too much stuff.
EDIT: I do not want to deal with all the registering and stuff the API would require... I think I may just try to make one using the zone charts USPS provides.


The USPS has rate calculator APIs available for both domestic and international. You can learn more about them at the following site. Hope that helps.
