When is SqlConnection.RetrieveStatistics() useful?
.net sql sql-server
What are the problems that calling this method can help with?
Do you ever use it in debugging you data access?


This page from MSDN has more information. Seems like it contains useful debugging information but I must admit I've never used it.
