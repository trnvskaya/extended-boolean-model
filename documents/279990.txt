Where can I find sample code on mouse movements and polygon spins in OpenGL?
I am using Java, so sample code in Java is preferred.


You'd probably find this useful:

If you would like to use the JOGL java libraries very useful sample code can be found here.
JOGL is pretty straight foreword and easy to grasp. Just be aware, the object oriented nature might make future/more advanced work with OpenGL in C/C++ a bit harder to grasp. 
MainWindow.java in the .zip below is an example of exactly what your looking for. The code comes from the above link.
