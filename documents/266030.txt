How to set a timeout during remote ejb lookup?
java java-ee jndi
I'm trying to access a remote ejb which is not available yet. But the lookup takes 5 min before I get the NameNotFoundException. Is there a way I can set the lookup timeout to a lesser value so that the client application doesn't hang for 5 mins? 
Thanks in advance...


Do the lookup in another thread, so that the client GUI does not hang. You can use plain Runnable to do this, or try a better option like swingworker.
To customize the JNDI lookup timeout, I am afraid, you will have to hack the internals of an open source app server, if that is an option.

That's exactly what we are doing. But this brings another problem: It seems that it is not possible to lookup a EJB on another server as long as the erroneous lookup is hanging.
Is there any way to avoid this and get further lookups working?
