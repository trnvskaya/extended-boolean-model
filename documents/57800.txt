What's the bare minimum permission set for Sql Server 2005 services?
sql-server-2005 security system-administration
Best practices recommend not installing Sql Server to run as SYSTEM.  What is the bare minumum you need to give the user account you create for it?


Typically I create a Domain User with only the specific rights on the network which I will require the server to have (i.e. to write to the network backup drive), I then add the account to local power users or local administrators depending on what needs to be done on the machine, however this isn't required.  I've installed SQL a number of times using a standard user as a Service Account but you need to ensure that the user has access to write to the resources as listed at http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;Q283811 .  Its probably not as defined an answer as you wanted but I'm only a developer (not a professional DBA / System Engineer).

PS dont downmark me for saying "only a developer" :P

By default, SQL Server 2005 installation will create a security group called SQLServer2005MSSQLUser$ComputerName$MSSQLSERVER with the correct rights. You just need to create a domain user or local user and make it a member of that group.
