How to find out Subversion repository version?
svn
How can I determine current version of my repository to see if I need to upgrade it (svnadmin upgrade)?
In reality I'm hosting SVN with 3rd party and I want to find out if I need to ask them to upgrade my repos or not.
I'm asking since 1.5 server will keep repo version at 1.4, unless I miss something?


Have a look at <REPO>/db/format. After upgrading to 1.5 format, my format file shows:
3
layout sharded 1000

Before it used to be:
2


Take the http or https link to your repository and cut & paste it into a browser.  The Subversion repository server version appears in the footer by default.

Powered by Subversion version 1.4.5 (r25188).

One would assume that a 1.4 server won't be running against a 1.5 repository.
For details, see the Subversion 1.5 Release Notes
Thanks to @Omus for the correction.

I would also suggest spoofing response headers because some server installations (VisualSVN Server comes to mind) uses custom pages which unfortunately doesn't show Subversion server version.
You could use Fiddler2 to spoof request/response to the server. If You're using an HTTPS connection be sure to check "Decrypt HTTPS traffic" option in: 
Tools->Fiddler Options->HTTPS

You can check the content of the file "format" under the "db" directory. If it shows 3 then it has been upgraded to 1.5 (that's the version of the updated fielsystem). If it is 2 then it is 1.4 or older.

For VisualSVN Server, even it uses custom pages, you can still view the page source:)

I think what you want is "svnlook youngest"
