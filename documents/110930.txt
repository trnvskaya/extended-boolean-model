interval rails caching
ruby-on-rails ruby caching
I need to cache a single page. I've used ActionController's caches_page for this. But now, I'd like to expire AND regenerate it once in every 10 minutes. What are my options?
later: I'd like to not use any external tools for this, like cron. The important point is interval-based expiry of the cache. 


AFAIK rails page caching compares the cache time on request and regenerates if necessary. If you need to forcibly flush that cache check out Sweepers.

You can also use this if you want to have fragments timeout.
