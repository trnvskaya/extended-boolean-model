Where to look for database samples/schema?
sql database
I found http://www.databaseanswers.org/data_models/ very useful. Any other suggestions?


Microsoft have db samples in VS2005 and VS2008, but you can also download it from here:
Northwind Database

Here and here are two similar questions with lots of answers on stackoverflow.

If you're just looking for data models, I recommend the following books:

The Data Model Resource Book, Vol.
1: A Library of Universal Data
Models for All Enterprises
The Data Model Resource Book, Vol. 2: A Library of Data Models for Specific Industries 
The Data Model Resource Book: Universal Patterns for Data Modeling 

I have Vol 1 and Vol 2 and these have been pretty helpful in the past.
