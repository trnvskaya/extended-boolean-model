How to add CardSpace support to your ASP.NET application
.net asp.net security cardspace
I like the idea of CardSpace but unlike OpenID it seems like a real PITA
to support it in your ASP.NET web application. I've found many examples, even a tutorial
in one of the books I own... but it would seem a lot more is required than what they suggest.

Can someone tell me:

What I need to configure in IIS7
How to implement CardSpace support without using to many 3rd party components
Have you managed to get it working?

I think the complexity (or poor documentation) is one of the reasons CardSpace is lagging behind.
(I'm interested in what others think about this, but lets not turn this into a flame war, I just want a solution and perhaps your thoughs in short)


For card space take a look at the open source library SharpSTS a https://sharpsts.com/
They also have links to a number of card space resources that might help you get started at: https://sharpsts.com/resources.aspx 

Rob Conery is implementing CardSpace in his new project.

I have blogged about that, but it is in Swedish. I hope we can rely on google translate. :-)
