How to get the base 10 logarithm of a Fixnum in Ruby?
ruby math logarithm
I want to get the base 10 logarithm of a Fixnum using Ruby, but found that n.log or n.log10 are not defined. Math::log is defined but uses a different base than 10.
What is the easiest way to get the base 10 logarithm of a Fixnum?


Reading the documentation for module Math the answer is really obvious:
Math::log10(n)

This gives the base 10 logarithm of n.

Math.log10(numeric) => float
returns base 10 log

There is  
Math::log10 (n)

And there is also a property of logarithms that logx(y) = log(y)/log(x)
