Installing SVN username password issue
svn passwords username
I'm installing SVN with Apache 2.2 on windows 2003 everything seems good but when I try to login no username/password works
Here is some info
I load this module in httpd.conf
LoadModule auth_basic_module modules/mod_auth_basic.so

and in svnserv.conf i have
[general]
anon-access=read
auth-access=write

password-db=passwd
authz-db=authz

in the passwd file
[users]
harry=harry
sally=sally


what am I doing wrong or missign?


Ok, this isnt't technically an answer to the question you've asked, but you should try installing Visual SVN Server, which takes care of all of these headaches for you.  Setting up an SVN server is much easier with this tool on Windows than it is to do by hand.

This really isn't the forum for this type of question. You'd be better of in #subversion on irc.freenode.net

I think the problem might be that you need to generate the password file using htpasswd. Storing unencrypted passwords isn't a good thing!
