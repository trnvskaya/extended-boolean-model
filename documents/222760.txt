Insert cell comments in excel programmaticaly
c# excel .net-3.5 openxml
What's the better way to insert cell comments in excel 2007 files programmaticaly using c# and .net 3.5?


Have you tried using VSTO ? You can easily load an Excel document and manipulate it. To add a comment to a cell, load the file, activate the worksheet, then select the cell as a range and set the comment.

I just did exactly that but with MS Word (using Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word
range.Comments.Add ( range, ref _categoryMessage );
So, I would suggest using Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel and the similar method.
Consider this from MSDN:

The accepted answer points in the right direction, but the correct syntax is:
Excel.Range cell; 
cell.AddComment("My comment");


Excel._Worksheet oSheet =
  (Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel._Worksheet) excelWorkbook.ActiveSheet;
oSheet.Cells[2, 3].Cells.AddComment("Selam");
