Changing short date format in Ubuntu
datetime ubuntu
How do I change the system-wide short date format in Ubuntu?  For example, Thunderbird is showing dates in the DD/MM/YY format, and I would like to change it to MM/DD/YY or YYYY-MM-DD.
The best information I can find so far is in this thread:

Edit: I want to change the system-wide date format, so that all my applications use this new date format.


Well, I don't see how this is a Ubuntu question, since you are wanting to change the date format in Thunderbird.  I did find the following article on changing the date format for Thunderbird, but I don't think it allows you to change it to either of the formats you are asking about.

Thunderbird uses the system's date format, and that format depends on the system's locale settings. You have two options:

modify the system locale, the instructions are in the forum thread you linked above, or
set LC_TIME to a locale that uses the format you want. The article linked by Craig H suggests en_DK.


I've written a mini Howto on this.  It's not as easy as I had expected, but shouldn't pose too many problems.
