Implement validation as a method or as a property?
c#
I have an object that needs a test if the object data is valid. The validation itself would be called from the thread that instatiated the object, it looks like this:
 {
  if (_step.Equals(string.Empty)) return false;
  if (_type.Equals(string.Empty)) return false;
  if (_setup.Equals(string.Empty)) return false;
  return true;
}

Would it be better to implement this as a property, or as a method, and why? I have read the answers to a related question, but I don't think this specific question is covered there.


I would say as a Property.
if(something.IsValid) { ...

looks better then
if(something.IsValid()) { ...

Also an example from MSDN: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.ui.page.isvalid(VS.71).aspx

My personal opinion here would be:

If the "validate" method mutates the object in any way (which your example doesn't) then make it a method.
If the object remains un-changed after validation, make it a property.


That code needs refactoring. This is how you write code in Java, not in C#. In C#, you've got operator overloading.
if (_step == "")) return false;
if (_type == "")) return false;
if (_setup == "")) return false;

This is the idiomatic way of doing the comparison. Your way, besides being more verbose, is just unexpected and inconsistent in C#.
If, and only if, there's a chance that these strings are actually null instead of empty, use the following instead:
if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(_step)) return false;
