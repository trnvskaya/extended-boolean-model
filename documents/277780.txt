Input Audio as a Stream in CF 3.5
.net audio input inputstream audio-streaming
I googled around and coulnd't really find an answer.
How do I open an audio input device (namely a microphone) as a stream (preferably) on a CE/WinMobile device using Compact Framework?
I looked at WindowsMobile.DirectX, at various classes that contained Audio in their name and nothing seemed to do the trick.
What I want to do is basically to stream the audio input over the network to the server.


The usual answer for "trying to do something with the CF and can't" is OpenNetCF.
Here's the page for WaveAudio which includes a Recorder class with a RecordFor method that records to a stream for a given number of seconds.  It's not quite ideal for your purposes, but really close.  The OpenNetCF folk tend to be pretty responsive to requests.
