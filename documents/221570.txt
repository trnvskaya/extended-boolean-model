What code highlighting libs are there for Java?
java syntax-highlighting codehighlighter
I'd like them to be easy to bundle, with few dependencies and easy to use.

Do you want to highlight Java code or use a Java lib to highlight some other code?
I use these two: https://jhighlight.dev.java.net/ (server-side) for xml and http://code.google.com/p/syntaxhighlighter/ (js lib) for other stuff. The latter has something called 'brushes' which are "pluggable" .js for several langauges. If you are doing simple highlighting, I recommend the ,js approach.

http://tohtml.com/ this one is good.

A little update, as we were recently looking for highlighting lib, we found the very good Jygments : http://code.google.com/p/jygments/ .
Available for Ant/Maven/SBT projects throught threecrickets repo, it's a Java port of Pygments ( http://pygments.org ), working for several major languages.

RSyntaxTextArea is worked for meHere
        RSyntaxTextArea textArea = new RSyntaxTextArea();
        textArea.setSyntaxEditingStyle(SyntaxConstants.SYNTAX_STYLE_JAVA);
        textArea.setCodeFoldingEnabled(true);
        RTextScrollPane rs = new RTextScrollPane(textArea);
