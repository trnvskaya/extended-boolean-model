How to search through archived files with Perl
perl search file-io compression
What is your preferred method for reading through the contents of zipped directories with Perl ?


There are several modules on CPAN for working with various archive formats (zip, tar, etc.), the one you're probably after is Archive::Zip.

If you want the contents of a .tar.gz archive
open(DIR_LISTING, "gzip -dc concert25.tgz | tar -tf -|") || die;
while (<DIR_LISTING>) {
   print;
}
close (DIR_LISTING);


Archive::Zip
require Archive::Zip;
my $zip = Archive::Zip->new($somefile);
for($zip->memberNames()) {
  print "$_\n";
}
