How to implement CEditListCtrl?. List control with edit capabality (Report/Grid view).
I have a list view in Report View. It has some values. I need to extend this to edit the values present in the list view.
I declared a class which inherits from CListCtrl. And I have handled the two Window messages to start and end the edit. Upon getting the messages I am displaying a Text box. But I am not getting the control inside these message handlers. Is there a way to know the reason?
Or Is there a other way to implement this.


You need to use a CComboBox which is basically a combined CEdit and CListCtrl

There are some neat grid controls on Code Project which might help:

Thanks for all answers
I have done it easily.

I have handled the WM_LBUTTONDOWN. This handler pops up the edit box to get the new
  value for the field
Handled LVN_ENDLABELEDIT to know the end of update.
After receiving the above message, updated the values.

âOne thing I forgotten was to set the flag in the resource view for CListCtrl (Edit Labels to TRUE)â
We have to implement OnPaint() (in CListCtrl's derived class) also otherwise the UI won't update properly
