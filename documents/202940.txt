Unit tests framework for databases
sql-server database unit-testing
IÂ´m looking for a unit tests framework for database development. IÂ´m currently developing for SQL Server 2000, 2005 and 2008.  Do you know of any good frameworks with similar functionality as JUnit and NUnit?
Perhaps itÂ´s better to ask, what do you use to unit test your stored procedures and user defined functions?


There is TSQLUnit... Link here: http://tsqlunit.sourceforge.net/

Isn't that question quite similar to What is the best way to test a stored procedure? ?

I tend to use a data access assembly and test that with NUnit using the idea outlined in
http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove/articles/dbunittesting.aspx
it uses transactions to rollback changes.  This is not a dedicated database approach but is good if you want to test at a higher level than pure database.
It may be worth having a look at http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove/archive/2004/07/12/180189.aspx

I'm currently using DBUnit in my project. It's quite a good tool to test a database to see if the results you expect are there, but also it can alter the data in a database to predefined values, for example, it will reset a database to the data you were using before the tests, leaving the tables unchanged.

I've also come across T.S.T. the T-SQL Test Tool
