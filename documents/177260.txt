Any viewstate implementation for JSP-Servlet app?
jsp viewstate
Do you know any implementation / technique which would provide similar behavior as Viewstate provides in ASP.NET. (Serializing the data into hidden field within the HTML form).
I am using only JSP, Servlet, and Spring MVC.


I think the Stripes framework provides that.

Spring Webflow offers a similar facility, scoped to individual conversations.  The persistence section of the manual should be able to explain the concepts.

you can easily do it JSP . get object steam and cover to ASCII data by using base64
