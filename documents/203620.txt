How to make a bilingual site without creating a separate ASP page for each language?
layout internationalization
I need ideas on how to go about table layout problem.
I want to set different width of the columns dependent on the picked language.


Use if-else inside scriplet based on the currently selected language and place appropriate "td" tags.
Hope this is what you are looking for !

A variable switch, such as:
<%
dim columnWidth
if session("lang") = "eng" then
    columnWidth = 50
else
    columnWidth = 100
end if
%>

<table>
    <tr>
        <td width="<%= columnWidth %>px">[content]</td>
    </tr>
</table>

For c#, the code would be:
<%
private int columnWidth;
if (session("lang") == "eng") {
    columnWidth = 50;
} else {
    columnWidth = 100;
}
%>


You can have language specific CSS, and then simply load the appropriate CSS based on language.
In the CSS you can add styles to your table for defining the layout.
