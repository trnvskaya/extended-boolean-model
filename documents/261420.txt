start specific iis 6.0 website via script
iis iis-6
I've googled around and can't find a clear answer.
I simply want to start some of my iis 6.0 websites via a script that will be run on start up.
anyone got any tips for that?


Well, I've googled around, and this is what I've found.
Snippet :
cd \inetpub\adminscripts    
Cscript.exe adsutil.vbs START_SERVER W3SVC/1
