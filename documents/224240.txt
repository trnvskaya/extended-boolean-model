What is the difference between iPod touch and iPod touch 2nd generation?

When submitting an app to the app store what is the real difference between iPod Touch and iPod Touch 2nd generation?  


The first-gen iPod touch doesn't ship with iPhone OS 2.0, which is required to run App Store apps. End-users can purchase iPhone OS 2.0 for their first-gen iPod touch from Apple.
From an SDK perspective, I'm not sure what, if anything, has changed.

Also, 2G iPod touches have microphone input capabilities and a built in speaker, as well as external volume buttons.
Also, the physical back of the device is curved, making it easier to hold.

The following:

Slightly thinner
Built-in support for Nike+
Volume bar
External speaker
Faster processor (533MHz vs 400MHz)
Supports new headphones with the microphone and volume control (allowing you to use VOIP apps)
