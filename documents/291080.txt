We're trying to track down some .Net assembly dependency problems.
On Windows XP, does the .Net 3.5 installer include 3.0 SP2 automatically?


I'm not sure but I believe that Microsoft is building on top of each version of .NET. This leads me to believe the answer to your question is 'Yes'. Hopefully someone can confirm this.

.NET 3.5 contains .NET 3.0 SP1
.NET 3.5 SP1 contains .NET 3.0 SP2
