How to make git ignore changes in case?
windows git
I'm not too sure what is going on here, but sometimes a particular file in my repository will change the case of it's name. e.g.,:
before: File.h
after: file.h
I don't really care why this is happening, but this causes git to think it is a new file, and then I have to go and change the file name back. Can you just make git ignore case changes?
[edit]
I suspect it is Visual Studio doing something weird with that particular file, because it seems to happen most often when I open and save it after changes. I don't have any way to fix bugs in VS however, but git should be a bit more capable I hope.


Since version 1.5.6 there is an ignorecase option available in the [core] section of .git/config
e.g. add ignorecase = true
To change it for just one repo, from that folder run:
git config core.ignorecase true

To change it globally: 
git config --global core.ignorecase true


In git version 1.6.1.9 for windows I found that "ignorecase=true' in config was already set by default.

The situation described in the question is now re-occuring with Mac OS X, git version >= 1.7.4 (I think). The cure is to set your ignorecase=false and rename the lowercased files (that git changed that way, not Visual Studio) back to their UsualCase by hand (i.e. 'mv myname MyName').
More info here.

You can force git to rename the file in a case-only way with this command:
git mv --cached name.txt NAME.TXT

Note this doesn't change the case of the file in your checked out copy on a Windows partition, but git records the casing change and you can commit that change. Future checkouts will use the new casing.
