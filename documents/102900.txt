Build new computer using Scripts
windows scripting build-automation
I would like to automate the process of setting up a new PC, this would include downloading and installing the latest windows and office updates; installing software from a network share (some software will require a restart so the script would need to be able to login and continue) adding PC to a domain and setting up local user accounts.
Is this possible and what would be the best scripting language to achieve this?


Check out nLite. Allows you to pre-configure many options, slipstream updates and service packs, etc.
