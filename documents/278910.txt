How do I collapse elements in a Report Table?
reporting-services
I have an SSRS report where I need to collapse data into a summary column like so:
+Program
-Program2
  Program2DataElement1 | Program2DataElement2 | etc.
How does one doe this?  I see it in other reports, but can't for the life of me find the area to set it up.  When I put in a group, I get something like this on all records: 
Program
  ProgramDataElement | ProgramDataElement | ...
What am I mising?  Thanks in advance!


I believe these are the steps:

Edit group
Click on Visibility Tab
For Initial Visibility, select the "hidden" radio button.


For SSRS 2008 - We have:

Select Group Properties for Program2DataElement at Row Groups
Select option Visibility
When the report is initially run: Hide
Check Display can be toggled by this report item: Program2
