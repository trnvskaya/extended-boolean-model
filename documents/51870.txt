How to force my ASP.net 2.0 app to recompile
asp.net .net-2.0
I have a ASP.net 2.0 app and I have made some changes the the source file ( cs files ). I uploaded the changes with the belief that it would auto-recompile. I also have the compiled dll in MY_APP/bin. I checked it and noticed that it did not recompile. Please understand I am new to this.


Where did you upload the changes? Source control, web server? 
Did you run a build first? Local or remotely?

In VS menu you have Build -> Rebuild Solution

my #1 way to do this, add white space to the top of the web config file, after the xml declaration tag.
It forces the node to re-cache and recompile. We even have a page deep in the admin called Flush.aspx that does it for us.

It's always best to just actually run a build after making .cs changes. 
Where are you running it? Is this for debugging or production?

I use a similar method to ChanChan, but instead of whitespace I put a comment in the web.config to indicate when/why the config was edited.
