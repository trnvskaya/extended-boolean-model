Service that provides DVD Covers art?
service dvd
Are there any services that allow you to retrieve DVD cover information?  I'm working on a small WPF application where this functionality would be handy.  If a user inserts a DVD or types a title in, it'll automatically grab the cover art for that DVD.
Thanks.


I haven't used it before but I believe that this is available through the Amazon Associates Web Service. Unfortunately...

You may use the data in the Amazon Associates Web Service as long as it's used primarily to drive traffic back to Amazon's web sites or sales of Amazon products and services.

...so this may not be suitable for you.

Amazon offers an API to access product images. This blog post offers a way to do it through PHP using the aforementioned API.

Not sure if they have an API, but you should check out http://albumart.org. Also check out http://www.freecovers.net/api, a similar service.
