How can I change the size of scroll box(thumb) of a CScrollBar?
mfc scrollbar
I can't find any method to change it. Any help will be appreciated!


The size of the scroll box is controlled by the range and page size of the scroll bar. You can use the CScrollBar::SetScrollInfo function to control these settings, specifically the nMin, nMax, and nPage members of the SCROLLINFO structure.
You can find more information on scroll bars on this page in MSDN - read the "Scroll Box Position and Scrolling Range" section.
