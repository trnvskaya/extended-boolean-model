Is it possible to get a core dump of a running process and its symbol table?
debugging
Is it possible to get gdb or use some other tools to create a core dump of a running process and it's symbol table?  It would be great if there's a way to do this without terminating the process.  
If this is possible, what commands would you use?  (I'm trying to do this on a Linux box)



$ gdb --pid=26426
(gdb) gcore
Saved corefile core.26426
(gdb) detach


Or run gcore $(pidof processname).
This has the benefit (over running gdb and issuing commands to the CLI) that you attach and detach in the shortest possible time. 

Note: The following method will terminate the running process & requires the symbols too.
You can send one of the following signals (with action=core) to the running process:

       SIGTTIN   21,21,26    Stop    Terminal input for background process
       SIGTTOU   22,22,27    Stop    Terminal output for background process

Like so:
kill <signal> <pid>
And once you have the core, you can open in gdb along with the symbol file.
