What do you call a chart that illustrates class hierarchy?
oop uml
So I have a UML type chart that documents the classes and the hierarchy of a development. Just don't know what you'd call it?
Any suggestions?


Class diagram is a nice start ;-).

Static Structure is another name for that entire suite of diagrams.
