Which SharePoint 2007 features are not available to Office 2003 users?
sharepoint ms-office
I have been tasked with coming up with a compatibility guide for SharePoint 2007 comparing Office 2003 and Office 2007. Does anyone know where to find such a list?
I have been searching for awhile but I cannot seem to find a comprehensive list.
Thanks :)


There is an entire MS white paper on Office integration with SharePoint:
