Spring Integration as embedded alternative to standalone ESB
spring jdbc soa esb spring-integration
Does anybody has an experience with Spring Integration project as embedded ESB?
I'm highly interesting in such use cases as:

Reading files from directory on schedule basis
Getting data from JDBC data source
Modularity and possibility to start/stop/redeploy module on the fly (e.g. one module can scan directory on schedule basis, another call query from jdbc  data source etc.)
repeat/retry policy

UPDATE:
I found answers on all my questions except "Getting data from JDBC data source". Is it technically possible?


This link describes the FileSucker with Spring Integration. Read up on your Enterprise Integration patterns for more info I think.
I kinda think you need to do a bit more investigation your self, or do a couple of tries on some of your usecases. Then we can discuss whats good and bad

Remember, "ESB" is just a marketing term designed to sell more expensive software, it's not a magic bullet. You need to consider the specific jobs you need your software to do, and pick accordingly. If Spring Integration seems to fit the bill, I wouldn't be too concerned if it doesn't look much like an uber-expensive server installation.

JDBC Adapters appear to be a work in progress.
Even if there is no specific adapter available, remember that Spring Integration is a thin wrapper around POJOs.  You'll be able to access JDBC in any component e.g. your service activators.
See here for a solution based on a polling inbound channel adapter too. 

The Spring Integration JDBC adapters are available in 2.0, and we just released GA last week. Here's the relevant section from the reference manual: http://static.springsource.org/spring-integration/docs/latest-ga/reference/htmlsingle/#jdbc
