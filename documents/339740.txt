Looking for an example of using Lucene.net with ASP.NET
asp.net lucene.net
How do you implement the search capabilities of Lucene.net in asp.net? If possible, please include links or example code.


I think mojoPortal (ASP.NET CMS) uses Lucene.NET.
Another nice example, cuyahoga, makes also use of NHibernate.
You can take a look at their source...
extra codeproject link

Be sure to check out LINQ to Lucene. It's not feature complete, but it does make getting started a lot easier:

I documented how I use Lucene.NET in my ASP.NET application BugTracker.NET here:
http://www.ifdefined.com/blog/post/2009/02/Full-Text-Search-in-ASPNET-using-LuceneNET.aspx

There is a excellent blog series here:

Lucene.NET
Introduction to Lucene
Indexing basics
Search basics
Alternatives ( did you mean â¦)
Faceted search / Drill down
Class reference

I have also found another project called SimpleLucene which you can use to maintain your lucene indexes whenever you need to update or delete a document.
