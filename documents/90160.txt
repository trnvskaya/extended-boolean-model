Integrating with Google Docs
google-docs
Has anyone integrated an "Open in Google Docs" in their web app yet? Gmail has this for opening attachments. How about any other sightings of this in a non-google web app?


You have to give a look to the Google Documents List Data API

Google Docs does have an API which allows you to search, upload, delete and retrieve documents from the Google Docs list of a specific user.  You could conceivably use this to upload a document from your server and then retrieve the URL of that document (once it is imported), which you can then use to redirect the user.  It wouldn't be quite as slick as Gmail's integration since you wouldn't be able to show that fancy "Importing your document..." page, but it might suffice.
As for other sightings, I am not aware of any.

If you only need this functionality for yourself you could download the "Send to google docs" firefox extension. That will add a right-click menu on all document links on the web and allow you to open them in google docs.

There is a gdata objective-c implementation for the api access.
