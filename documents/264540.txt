using jython and open office 2.4 to convert docs to pdf
python jython openoffice.org
I completed a python script using pyuno which successfully converted a document/ xls / rtf etc to a pdf.
Then I needed to update a mssql database, due to open office currently supporting python 2.3, it's ancientness, lacks support for decent database libs. So I have resorted to using Jython, this way im not burdened down by running inside OO python environment using an old pyuno.
This also means that my conversion code is broken, and I need to now make use of the java libraries instead of the pyuno libs.

import com.sun.star.beans.PropertyValue as PropertyValue
  import com.sun.star.bridge.XUnoUrlResolver as XUnoUrlResolver
  import com.sun.star.comp.helper.Bootstrap as Bootstrap
  ->> import com.sun.star.frame.XComponentLoader as XComponentLoader
  ->> import com.sun.star.frame.XStorable as XStorable
  import com.sun.star.lang.XMultiComponentFactory as XMultiComponentFactory
  import com.sun.star.uno.UnoRuntime as UnoRuntime
  import com.sun.star.uno.XComponentContext as XComponentContext  

The includes with the '->>' do not import the compiler does not recognise the com.sun.star.frame cant see the 'frame' bit. These are the libs I have included.

Some advice on this matter would be well received

context = XComponentContext
  xMultiCompFactory = XMultiComponentFactory
  xcomponentloader = XComponentLoader  
//used in python
  ctx = None
  smgr = None
  doc = None
  url = None  
context = Bootstrap.bootstrap()
  xMultiCompFactory = self.context.getServiceManager()
  xcomponentloader = UnoRuntime.queryInterface(XComponentLoader.class,  ....xMultiCompFactory.createInstanceWithContext("com.sun.star.frame.Desktop", context))  
file = "file:\\" + file
  // also what is the equivalent of url = uno.systemPathToFileUrl(file) in Java so that I can make use of it to nicely format my path
  properties = []
  p = PropertyValue()
  p.Name = "Hidden"
  p.Value = True
  properties.append(p)
  properties = tuple(properties)
  doc = xcomponentloader.loadComponentFromURL(file, "_blank",0, properties)  



Using Jython is a great idea for this I think. But why could you not use two scripts, one with pyuno/2.3 and one with pymssql/2.5 (or whatever db adapter you are using)?.
The intermediate format could be anything like a pickle, or json, or XML.
Edit: I should add that I have used pyuno quite extensively, and I feel your pain.

And so it goes, according to this guy, you need some oil.... and it works like a charm

include this lib C:\OpenOffice_24\program\classes\unoil.jar
