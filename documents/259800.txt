Is there a built in .NET exception that indicates an illegal object state?
c# .net exception
What exception should I throw if I encounter an illegal state - for instance, an initialization method that should only be called once being called a second time?  I don't really see any built-in exception that makes sense.  This seems like something that should be in the framework - am I not poking in the right spot?


InvalidOperationException maybe?

The exception that is thrown when a method call is invalid for the object's current state. 


If at all I'd say System.InvalidProgramException get nearest to what you want. What's wrong with throwing a custom exception?
