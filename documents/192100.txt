Is there a way to extract .NET 2.0 from the .NET 3.5?
.net deployment .net-2.0 .net-3.5
.NET Framework 3.5 SP1 installs the .NET Framework 2.0 SP2 and the .NET Framework 3.0 SP2 behind the scenes. These installation packages (especially .NET Framework 2.0 SP2) are not available directly from Microsoft.
Is there a way to extract them from the .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 installation package?


If they aren't available directly then there isn't an official way to install them separately and even if you were able to extract them you would end up with a very unsupported (and probably unstable) .NET environment.

You could simply download the .NET Framework 2.0 SP1 (x86), the SP2 patch (directly if you can find it, the .MSP by extracting from the 3.5 SP1 installer, or the .MSP via WSUS, or by capturing the Windows Update HTTP traffic), and create a batch file which installs SP1 then SP2 on top of it with the /silent switch. No reboot required as such between the full SP1 distribution and the SP2 patch, except when files are in use before installing the SP1 runtime, which would be the case with a complete distribution anyway.
Here is a procedure I also used to follow to integrate SP1 for NFX1.1 - I imagine it should work in a similar fashion for other patches too.

This is worth a read:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb822049.aspx
Specifically:
"Windows Vista does not support the standalone installation of the .NET Framework version 2.0 SP2 or version 3.0 SP2. Windows 2000 does not support the .NET Framework version 3.5 SP 1, nor the standalone installation of the .NET Framework version 3.0 SP 2."
Also - "If your application relies on changes that shipped with .NET Framework 2.0 SP 1 or SP 2, then you can have your application target the .NET Framework 2.0 and ask your customers to download the .NET Framework 2.0 SP 1 or SP 2. However, if your application relies on new or changed functionality, it is recommended that your application target the .NET Framework 3.5 or the .NET Framework Client Profile. "
Which does suggest there may be a standalone release at some point in the future, though your guess is as good as mine.
Also see this comment on Somasegar's blog from around the time of the beta about the background to 2.0 SP2:

You could unzip the dotnetfx35.exe and try and muddle your way through installing the .NET 2.0 SP2 bits on a throwaway/test machine to see if it works. The files are under wcu/dotNetFramework/dotNetfx20.
But my caveat would be wait until the official RTM or deploy the whole of 3.5SP1, you may, as Scott correctly points out, end up with an unstable and wholey unsupportable installation (specifically MS PSS).

Take a look on http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vs2008/bb898654.aspx or download .NET Frameworks 2.0 SP2 and 3.0 SP2 bootstrapper packages. These packages give you separate .NET Framework 2.0 SP2 and .NET Framework 3.0 SP2 installation packages.

Extract it with the /x switch, there is a cab file called adtbs_sp2oob.cab, inside it is a file called FL_FL_NetFx20SP2_x86.exe.3643236F_FC70_11D3_A536_0090278A1BB8, you can rename it to NetFx20SP2_x86.exe, If you need 64-bit, it's probably FL_NetFx20SP2_x64.3643236F_FC70_11D3_A536_0090278A1BB8. It should be completely independent, works OK for me so far.

You can download SP 2 completely separately by going to the Microsoft download site
