I am planning to learn Grails. Which is the best book that I should refer for this? Is there any website available on this for beginners?


There is good book for beginners The Definitive guide to Grails by Graeme Keith Rocher.
The Definitive Guide to Grails 2 is out.

I can provide you with a link for free pdf download. It isa pretty good book which explains the basics with good examples.

Keep in mind there are two books in the works that promise to be great Grails resources.  "The Definitive Guide to Grails 2nd Edition", by Graeme Rocher and Jeff Brown, is now available in alpha.  Glen Smith and Peter Ledbrook are also working on "Grails in Action", which should come out sometime soon this year.

The "Best Free Resources" are listed in this question:
