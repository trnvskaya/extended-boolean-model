Whats the best book/site/tutorial for learning object oriented php?
php oop
Im pretty familiar with procedural side of php, but I would like to learn the OO side of things. Can you guys suggest some (short) reads that would get me on my way?
Would prefer online articles, to paper. 


I'd personally reccomend PHP Objects, Patterns and Practice

The folks at No Starch Press have really impressed me over the last few years, and Object-Oriented PHP: Concepts, Techniques, and Code by Peter Lavin is no exception.
