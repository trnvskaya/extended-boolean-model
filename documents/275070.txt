Wheel Reinvention Avoidance for Web Rating Feature
javascript html
I have a need to implement a rating feature and would like to do it the mouse-over stars way similar to netflix.
What is my best approach? Here are some that come to mind.

code it up by hand in HTML and
javascript
use flash or a java applet
use Starbox (if you have used Starbox, then feel free to comment on it)
use another java script library (please specify)



Starbox is an easy to use way of doing it without reinventing the wheel.
I've done it before using HTML/js but it's not very easy and gets messy.
Flash and Java applets are an overkill, it's not worth the effort (I haven't used any "real" java applets in many years).

I really like jQuery Star Rating Plugin, non-obstrusive, will work even if JavaScript is disabled, its based on a set of radio input boxes, and its very easy to use.
