Bat file to run a .exe at the command prompt
windows batch-file exe
I want to create a .bat file so I can just click on it so it can run:
svcutil.exe /language:cs /out:generatedProxy.cs /config:app.config http://localhost:8000/ServiceModelSamples/service

Can someone help me with the structure of the .bat file?


Just put that line in the bat file...
Alternatively you can even make a shortcut for svcutil.exe, then add the arguments in the 'target' window.

A bat file has no structure...it is how you would type it on the command line. So just open your favourite editor..copy the line of code you want to run..and save the file as whatever.bat or whatever.cmd

What's stopping you?
Put this command in a text file, save it with the .bat (or .cmd) extension and double click on it...
Presuming the command executes on your system, I think that's it.

Just stick in a file and call it "ServiceModelSamples.bat" or something.
You could add "@echo off" as line one, so the command doesn't get printed to the screen:
@echo off
svcutil.exe /language:cs /out:generatedProxy.cs /config:app.config http://localhost:8000/ServiceModelSamples/service


If you want to be real smart, at the command line type:

echo svcutil.exe /language:cs /out:generatedProxy.cs /config:app.config http://localhost:8000/ServiceModelSamples/service >CreateService.cmd

Then you have CreateService.cmd that you can run whenever you want (.cmd is just another extension for .bat files)

it is very simple code for executing notepad 
bellow code type into a notepad and save to extension .bat  Exapmle:notepad.bat
start "c:\windows\system32" notepad.exe   

(above code "c:\windows\system32" is path where you kept your .exe program and notepad.exe is your .exe program file file)
enjoy!

To start a program and then close command prompt without waiting for program to exit:
start /d "path" file.exe


If your folders are set to "hide file extensions", you'll name the file *.bat or *.cmd and it will still be a text file (hidden .txt extension).  Be sure you can properly name a file!

Well, the important point it seems here is that svcutil is not available by default from command line, you can run it from the vs xommand line shortcut but if you make a batch file normally that wont help unless you run the vcvarsall.bat file before the script.
Below is a sample

"C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio *version*\VC\vcvarsall.bat"
svcutil.exe /language:cs /out:generatedProxy.cs /config:app.config http://localhost:8000/ServiceModelSamples/service


You can use:
start "windowTitle" fullPath/file.exe

Note: the first set of quotes must be there but you don't have to put anything in them, e.g.:
start "" fullPath/file.exe


As described here, about the Start command, the following would start your application with the parameters you've specified:
start "svcutil" "svcutil.exe" "language:cs" "out:generatedProxy.cs" "config:app.config" "http://localhost:8000/ServiceModelSamples/service"


"svcutil", after the start command, is the name given to the CMD window upon running the application specified. This is a required parameter of the start command.
"svcutil.exe" is the absolute or relative path to the application you want to run. Using quotation marks allows you to have spaces in the path.
After the application to start has been specified, all the following parameters are interpreted as arguments sent to the application.
