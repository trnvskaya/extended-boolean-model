Can I make a SharePoint Image Web Part clickable to link to another page
sharepoint web-parts
The Image Web Part doesn't seem to have an href attribute that I can set.  Is there something I am missing?


Does it have to be an Image Web Part? If not I would simply use a Content Editor Web Part and paste the required HTML there.
<a href="http://www.google.com"><img src="urlToImage" /></a>


what if it have to? 
users need to have an opportunity to change the link and the image themselves and not to disturb an administrator.
