ASP.NET Membership: Login Controls Source Code
asp.net asp.net-membership visual-studio-2005 forms-authentication
Is the source code for the common login controls available?
Those are the controls which are available under Login section in Toolbox: 

Login,  
LoginView, 
PasswordRecovery,
LoginStatus, 
LoginName,
CreateUserWizard, 
ChangePassword

Eventually could you point me to a good source of custom implementation of functionality that those controls provide, or some guidance on implementing this functionality without using the mentioned controls.
I am using Visual Studio 2005 (.net2)
I will be using SQLMembershipProvider as the MembershipProvider but that probably should make no difference.


The source code for the entire framework is available. The link below provides some details as to how to access:

"the entire framework is available" is not true. :)

I am going to give this a qualified "NO".
I have gone down the road of implementing an implementation of the Login server control using reflected source as a starting point (this was before symbol server integration).
Things seem to go swimmingly, with a few reflection hacks to get to core framework members that obviate reams of code.
Until you get to the designers.  That infrastructure is a minefield and gets wide and deep with a quickness and is filled with even deeper buried internal types that need implementations or reflection hacks.
Ultimately wound up with a working control that I could extend but would never want to maintain.
The effort was not wasted; I learned a lot about how over engineered server controls are designed.
And then I just shifted a login control to template mode and got everything I needed to get done in a few lines of code. ;-)
Except as a learning experience I would certainly recommend against going down that road.
Good luck.
