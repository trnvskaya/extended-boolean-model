Good asp.net (C#) apps?
c# asp.net css design-patterns
Any suggestions for good open source asp.net (C#) apps out there which meet as many of the following:?

Designed well and multi tiered
Clean & commented code
Good use of several design patterns
Web pages display properly in all common browsers
Produces valid html and has good use of css
Use of css themes. Prefer usage of css than tables
NOT dependent on third party components (grids, menus, trees, ...etc)
Has good unit tests
Web pages are not simplistic and look professional
Uses newer technologies like MVC, LINQ.. (not important)
(Anything else that matters which I couldn't think of right now)



BlogEngine.Net

dasBlog which is a blogging platform that Scott Hanselman contributes to.

This is pretty cool. Upcoming ASP.NET feature source is available.

TaskVision: a simple and sometimes very usefull .net client-server demo application:
Go to website
Complete source code is available (see bottom right corner for download)

Code Plex ->

ASP.NET MVC - look at source
ASP.NET Dynamic Data

I learned a lot from SutekiShop (mvc, repository pattern, ddd+tdd), TechAvalanche sample app (http://www.simonsegal.net/blog/CodeDownloads/Orm.zip, several design patterns, poco with linq), CodeBetter.Award sample app for ddd+tdd, and MVC Storefront from Rob Conery.   

Doesn't met all all points you specified but i'll mention it because i think is a good piece of software http://www.yetanotherforum.net/ 

I would have to agree with BlogEngine.  It implements a ton of different abilities and common needs in asp.net as well as allowing it to be fully customizable and very easy to understand.  It can work with XML or SQL (your choice) and has a huge community behind it.
As for your requests (bold means yes):

Designed well and multi tiered
Clean & commented code
Good use of several design patterns
Web pages display properly in all common browsers
Produces valid html and has good use of css
Use of css themes. Prefer usage of css than tables
NOT dependent on third party components (grids, menus, trees, ...etc) - kind of, still uses some custom dlls
Has good unit tests - not sure
Web pages are not simplistic and look professional - yes, and there are TONS of free templates out there 
Uses newer technologies like MVC, LINQ.. (not important) - not yet
(Anything else that matters which I couldn't think of right now) - a ton more stuff like dynamic rss feeds, dynamic sitemaps, data references, etc.

There is also a bunch more great open source projects available here: http://www.asp.net/community/projects/
I know that dotNetNuke is pretty popular as well, and the Classified Program is pretty easy to use.

Try to look at MojoPortal (http://www.mojoportal.com/)

You should have a look at SharpArchitecture which uses ASP.NET MVC, and which is an open source architecture foundation for web applications.

There is MojoPortal (http://www.mojoportal.com/) :

well designed 
css template & valid html => ok for all browsers
open source
perhaps not very modern (no MVC, no LINK...)
but runs on Mono

For a more up-to-date project, there is Dropthings (http://www.dropthings.com/) : an open source Web 2.0 style AJAX Portal built using ASP.NET 3.5, Workflow Foundation and LINQ.
And its author is considering making an ASP.NET MVC version using jQuery (http://weblogs.asp.net/omarzabir/archive/2008/07/15/open-source-asp-net-3-5-ajax-portal-new-and-improved.aspx)

You can try OXITE on codeplex.
