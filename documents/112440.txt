Javascript error
javascript
I'm getting a JS error on displaying a page: Nothing concrete is specified but the line where it seems to be thrown. When looking into the source code of the page, I see the error is thrown inside the following script, but I can't understand why! It's only about loading images!
    <SCRIPT language=JavaScript>
<!--
function newImage(arg) {
    var	rslt = new Image();
    rslt.src = arg;
    return rslt;
}
function changeImages(a, b) {
    a.src =	b;
}
newImage("\/_layouts\/images\/icon1.gif");
newImage("\/_layouts\/images\/icon2.gif");
// -->
</SCRIPT>

The error I am getting is when clicking on a drop down context menu on a page, for this line:
newImage("\/_layouts\/images\/icon1.gif");

Error: The object doesn't accept this property or method
Code: 0
I really don't see what could happen... Any tips on what may be happening here?
Thanks a lot!


Write proper xml with the " around attributes.
<script type="text/javascript">
function newImage(arg) {
    var rslt = new Image();
    rslt.src = arg;
    return rslt;
}
function changeImages(a, b) {
    a.src =     b;
}
newImage("/_layouts/images/icon1.gif");
newImage("/_layouts/images/icon2.gif");
</script>


should your script block not be:
<script type="text/javascript">

?

For starters, start your script block with
<script type="text/javascript">

Not
<script language=JavaScript>

That's probably not the root of your problem, but since we can't see your script, that's about all we can offer.

Have you tried loading your scripts into a JS debugger such as Aptana or Firefox plugin like Firebug?

You probably need to enlist the help of a Javascript debugger. I've never figured out how to make the various debuggers for IE work, so I can't help you if you're using IE.
If you're using Firefox or you CAN use Firefox, make sure you have a Tools / Javascript Debugger command. (If you don't, reinstall it and be sure to enable that option.) Next, open up the debugger, rerun the problem page, and see what comes up.

Why are you escaping the forward slashes. That's not necessary. The two lines should be:
newImage("/_layouts/images/icon1.gif");
newImage("/_layouts/images/icon2.gif");


How are you calling changeImages?  It looks as though you are not saving a reference to the images returned by newImage.  You probably want to save the results of newImage and pass that to the changeImages routine.  Then changeImages should look like this:
function changeImages(a, b) {
    a.src = b.src;
}

You also may want to ensure that the images have finished loading before calling changeImages.
You've posted the routine that throws the error, without posting the error or showing us how you are calling it.  If none of the answers posted fix your problem then please post some detail about how you are calling the method, which specific line the error is on, and what the error message is.

It is hard to answer your question with the limited information provided:

You are not showing the complete script
You never said what the exact error message is, or even what browser is giving the error.
Which line number is the error supposedly coming from?

I'd recommend using Firebug in firefox for debugging javascript if you aren't already.  IE tends to give bogus line numbers.
And as others have already said, the language attribute for script tags is deprecated.

You firebug to debug.

JSLint is also a nice resource.
