Detecting mouse double-click in Flash (AS2)
flash mouse actionscript-2 double-click
Is there a way to detect mouse double-click on a button object using ActionScript 2.0? 


To make explicit what the other answers imply, there's no built-in way. You just have to listen for two clicks and decide whether they're close enough together to count as a double, or else use a package that does that, or else use AS3.
