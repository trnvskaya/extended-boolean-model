TCustomDataSet C++ Builder
c++builder vcl
I'm looking for an example of a TCustomDataSet implementation in C++ beyond the TTextDataset example that ships as an example project within C++ Builder.
The TTextDataset is hard to learn from because the code is not documented very well and it only shows a single field example.
I've created my own class that descends TDataSet and it mostly works however, the GUI controls (grids mostly) don't work 100% for certain use cases.
Anyone have some good links on this topic...
Here is a link to the example code I used to study from:

I have a couple of examples. but unfortunately they are in Delphi, but you should get the idea:
Example 1
Example 2
The second one goes into a bit more explanation and is one I used to base a custom dataset on that did binding to UI (In delphi).
