What alternatives are there to the MATLAB Editor?
editor matlab
Some things that I personally find as shortcomings in the MATLAB Editor:

virtually no code completion available
does not run OS native (on MacOS) - but in X-Environment (shortcuts, copy&paste problems, keymappings, non intuitive window-managing)
virtually no refactoring tools

Are there alternative editors with these features?


I use emacs for MATLAB stuff, but then I use it for just about everything.
There's a MATLAB mode for emacs at http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/course/16-720/extras/matlab_in_emacs/index.html but I've never tried it. I don't think it has any refactoring support.

You can use any editor you like in MATLAB by going to 
File -> Preferences -> Editor/Debugger
and then change the radio button from 'MATLAB Editor' to 'Text editor' and the command for your editor of choice in there.  I use this to launch gedit on my Linux box.
On the Mac-Specific side - it seems that there is a MATLAB bundle for TextMate
http://kjosmoen.org/2007/6/15/bugfixes-in-the-textmate-matlab-bundle

There's also a TextMate bundle for MATLAB in the official
repository. I keep a fork of it in
[GitHub][1] too.
Incidentally, I recently became the maintainer, so I'm keen to get help and feedback from anyone who uses it. I've also tried to contact the author of the other bundle to get his changes pulled back into the mainline.
By far the easiest way to get working MATLAB/Octave support in TextMate is to use GetBundles. This is still in 'review', so you'll have to get this manually, but once you have, it's dead easy to search the Official SVN repo, and GitHub. 

Eclipse with the Colorer plugin has decent syntax highlighting. 
It doesn't solve the code completion problem, but if you're used to Eclipse, you don't waste time trying to work with the somewhat clumsy keyboard shortcuts of the native editor.
(And I'm a firm believer in the Pragmatic Programmer's recommendation to "Use a Single Editor Well")

I might be biased, but I use emacs for almost everything.  There is a really good emacs mode on MATLAB Central,
http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/104
I don't know if emacs meets all of your requirements,  but it's a pretty powerful and customizable editor.  
I've never used this, but here's an Eclipse Plugin that seems able to some MATLAB highlighting,

Searching for change MATLAB shortcuts here on StackOverflow yields some results.
I know VS and Eclipse well and IMO MATLAB IDE does its job pretty good. It is the only one with:

reasonably auto-complete because it knows which functions are in the MATLAB path.
debugger and command window.
easy input -> easy output, like a scientific pocket calculator running on PC

With MATLAB (or say Python) the approach to coding is different then with VS or Eclipse for say C++ or Java. For example - with command window in MATLAB IDE you can evaluate almost everything. Together with debugger you can write new code pieces and evaluate them in succession, it's like exploring. 
Being a dynamic language you also can not expect mach refactoring. So from a practical viewpoint it makes sense that MATLAB IDE is the way it is. Also the problems solved with MATLAB are different from these were Java is used.

We are developing an open source Matlab plugin for Eclipse which can be found at http://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/matclipse/
It's been used internally for some time and cleaned up to release it to the public. 

I just wanted to add that r2011b adds the ability to rename variables- a very small but often helpful feature.
