Select ..... where .... OR 
mysql
Is there a way to select data where any one of multiple conditions occur on the same field?
Example: I would typically write a statement such as:
select * from TABLE where field = 1 or field = 2 or field = 3

Is there a way to instead say something like:
select * from TABLE where field = 1 || 2 || 3

Any help is appreciated.


Sure thing, the simplest way is this:
select foo from bar where baz in (1,2,3)


select * from TABLE where field IN (1,2,3)

You can also conveniently combine this with a subquery that only returns one field:
    select * from TABLE where field IN (SELECT boom FROM anotherTable)


select * from TABLE where field in (1, 2, 3)

WHERE field IN (1, 2, 3)


OR:
SELECT foo FROM bar WHERE baz BETWEEN 1 AND 3


You can still use in for
select *
from table
where field  = '1' or field = '2' or field = '3'

its just
select * from table where field in ('1','2','3')
