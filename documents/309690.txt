Communicating from website to desktop application (not vice-versa)
protocols messaging custom-protocol
I am designing an application that will have to react to certain website actions, mostly in the same way as the Last.FM client does.
The way the Last.FM client works is that it first registers a custom protocol in Windows (lastfm://) after which certain player actions can be triggered via the website by following the links using this protocol. For example, following
lastfm://artist//similarartists

will direct any Last.FM client running to load similar artists.
I would like to implement something similar for my application with my own protocol and client.

Is this a good idea general? 
Are there any good alternatives to this mechanism of notifying a desktop client from the website?



I've often wanted to see more applications that do this because the integration between web and local makes for a great experience (if you ignore any spammy related qualms)

So what you are really asking is how to register a custom protocol in Windows?
MSDN has the official answer
From this SO discussion

Yes, it's a great idea, if you want to send a message from a website to a desktop without polling, custom protocls are probably the only way.
