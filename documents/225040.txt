Code Coverage on Visual Studio Team System 2008 Developer Edition (on an NUnit application)
.net visual-studio visual-studio-2008 nunit code-coverage
Is this possible? I am looking forward to a tutorial which explains the steps to achieve this.


TestDriven.NET has the ability to test (NUnit/MSTest/etc) with Team Coverage (which you already have since you have Team System : Dev).
Walkthrough: here (you also get the coverage results window for looking at the coverage per method) - but this says it all:

You can use NUnit tests, but use the MS IDE integration for colorization, percentagaes, etc (no need for NCover). I use this all the time ;-p
The advantages are:

no need to set up a "Test Run Configuration" (sorry, MSFT, but an own-goal there)
fully integrated with VS (Code Coverage Results and Coloring)
easy to use (just right-click -> Test With -> Team Coverage)
easy to debug too (right-click -> Test With -> Debugger)
easy to use the separate NUnit/NCover apps if you want  (right-click etc)


TestDriven.NET will also work very well with NCover. You can get some very nice html reports out of NCover, and you can integrate it with Nant.

Here's a tutorial on integrating NCover with MSBuild.  Here's a tutorial on how to tell Team Build to fail a build when NCover reports code coverage below a minimum threshold.  To my knowledge there isn't yet a way to publish your NCover results directly to the TFS data warehouse, but I'd love someone to prove me wrong.
