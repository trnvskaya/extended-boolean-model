Is there a service which will let me create a snippet of a webpage
code-snippets
I am looking for a way to get the essence or the most important aspect of a webpage? If I provide a URL, is there any external service which can accomplish this? I am not looking for snap.com like service as it provides a snapshot.
I might be willing to even implement such a system on my own. For beginning I do not want to put excessive effort, but rather would love to able to get some basic results. Are there any thoughts on how I may approach this problem?


By snippet, do you mean like a quote that sums up the entire page you want to link to? 
So if snap.com isn't a fancy, what about the entire page? For verbosity's sake? You could try out BackupURL if you want like a cache of the entire page of the site instead just a snapshot of a portion of it.

You can try Yahoo's Term extraction service
Update 02-May-2012
Yahoo has release a new Content Analysis Web service which will be replacing the Term extraction service. It can be invoked by syntactically sweet YQL as shown below
select * from contentanalysis.analyze where url='http://www.cnn.com/2011/11/11/world/europe/greece-main/index.html'; 

There is also AlchemyAPI which offers a weservice which may serve your purpose.
