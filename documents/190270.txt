Installing ASP.Net 2.0 after IIS
iis .net-2.0 installation
I just got a dedicated server from a hosting company, and for some reason, it didn't have IIS installed.
It did have .Net 2.0, though.
So I installed IIS, but now my ASP.net websites won't work.
I just get a 404, no event log entries, nothing...
I noticed in the redistributable package information that:
"To access the features of ASP.NET, IIS with the latest security updates must be installed prior to installing the .NET Framework"
I also can't uninstall .Net, it just won't let me...
Is there a way to reinstall .Net 2.0, or somehow do whatever it is it does to IIS to make it work?
Thanks!
Daniel


run from the command line
aspnet_regiis -i

You may have to navigate to the folder it was installed.
Mine and the default is
C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727


Be sure that you have enabled the extensions for asp and aspx in IIS.  They are disabled by default.  I'd do this before you go about uninstall more components.

same command you can run it from Visual Studio Command Prompt as well, then you don't need to navigate to above path
