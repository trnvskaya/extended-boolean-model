Drop Down List with WPF Menu Controls
c# .net wpf
I am looking for a way to add a drop down list in WPF to a menu. This used to be really easy in winforms and so I am expecting you experts to know just now to do it in WPF. Thanks.
Sorry if this is a bad question, it is late and I don't want to think.


It is very easy to add any UIElement to any control, You can just add Combobox to a Menu control and create menu as bellow
    <Menu >
        <MenuItem Header="File">
            <MenuItem Header="Open"/>
            <MenuItem Header="Close"/>
            <Separator/>
            <ComboBox Width="85" Height="21.96" />
        </MenuItem>
    </Menu>


While this is very easy to do as Jobi Joy has shown, I think it has horrible usability. The Menu control supports multiple levels of menu items and I would go down that route for UI consistency.
