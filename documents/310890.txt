Any DAL/ORM on GAE?
python google-app-engine orm rdbms data-access-layer
Is there any Database Abstraction Layer (DAL) or Object Relational Mapper (ORM) that works on Google App Engine (GAE), and on normal relational databases (RDBS), other  than web2py's?
If not, is anybody working on porting one of the existing DAL/ORM to GAE?


Currently, it looks like SQLAlchemy is working on it, but it's incomplete / unfinished.  Good luck!

There is an ORM for Google App Engine. There are some differences between it and SQLAlchemy, but looks like it works. Check this page: http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/datastore/entitiesandmodels.html

Web2Py has a DAL that is compatible to GAE. In fact, the whole framework can be deployed to GAE: http://mdp.cti.depaul.edu/examples/default/index
