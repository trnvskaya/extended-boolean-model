Team foundation and 64-bit windows, can't install?
tfs 64bit windows-server-2008 windows-server-2003
So is it a certified answer that you can't install Team foundation on windows 2008 64-bit?
Update
Is it better just do install it on windows 2003 or 2008?


short answer is no
Rereading I need to make clear for double negative, read link, official is that you can't but there is a workaround if desired.
