RTF control for .Net 1.1 Windows
.net control rtf
Can anyone recommend a cheap and good RTF control for .Net 1.1 Windows development. It needs to be able to do print/preview and some basic text formatting, fonts etc but nothing too advanced.
Cheers
Andreas


If you're interested in rolling out your own, the framework provides a RTF control by default. It's arcane, but one can learn enough RTF to create simple formatting, and printing/print previewing can both be implemented using native classes as well.

I think this article by Scott Lysle provides a good discussion on how to achieve what you want as well as some comprehensive source code to get you started.

We've used the TE EDIT Control from Sub Systems fairly extensively.  We evaluated a lot of controls and found this one to be the best by far.  The API is a little archaic but the tech support was very responsive and we were able to get it to do whatever we needed it to do.
