ASP.NET MVC and Ajax
asp.net asp.net-mvc
From what I've read about ASP.NET MVC, it appears it requires posting to work, is there any working example (With source available) of a ASP.NET MVC website that has no postbacks with the help of Ajax?
(I checked the related questions earlier but couldn't find what I was looking for)
Thanks in advance.
edit: I need jQuery solutions not Atlas Toolkit stuff!
