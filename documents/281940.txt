Are there any Ajax-based UML modeling tools?

I'm looking for something like WWW SQL Designer for UML Modeling.


This one is not in Ajax, it's in flash, at least it is online: http://www.gskinner.com/gmodeler/launch.html

Not totally UML but it's super user-friendly and automatically generates an AJAX application prototype based on your model. it saves us a lot of time. http://www.xifactory.com

Sequence diagrams are UML too.
