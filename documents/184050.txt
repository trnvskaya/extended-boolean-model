Eclipse PDT and .yml file, cannot open?
php eclipse yaml
I am using Symphony framework and I have the default sandbox inside the Eclipse IDE. When I double click schema.yml instead of open in Eclipse it requests Windows to select a program to choose. I am a Visual Studio guy and I do not understand why it doesn't open in Eclipse, what should I do?


Right click on the file, select OPEN WITH>Text Editor and it will open in the IDE
