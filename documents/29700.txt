Can someone point me to some guides for WPF
.net wpf
I am having trouble finding good guides for WPF.
I have experience in C# and .NET but  I don't know anything about WPF except for the regular marketing-ish description of the technology as a whole.
Can anyone point me to a good beginner's tutorial/guide on WPF.


I would buy a book - the Adam Nathan WPF book is good.
http://www.amazon.com/Windows-Presentation-Foundation-Unleashed-WPF/dp/0672328917

Ok, in terms of reading material, this is the pick of the books out there: Windows Presentation Foundation Unleashed.
For blogs, there are a lot of blogs and articles on WindowsClient.net, and there's an excellent blog all about data binding in WPF by Beatriz Costa. Also take a look at LearnWPF.com and Ask Dr. WPF.

Here are a few "How Do I" videos to get you started:

Scott Hanselmann has blogged extensively about his experience in learning WPF by creating his 'BabySmash' windows application. All the source code is on codeplex and he has many blog articles describing his progress.

Have a look at the Guided tour of WPF by Josh Smith. I also really like Adam's Nathan book WPF Presentation Unleashed.
