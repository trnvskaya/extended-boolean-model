.NET Runtime 2.0 Error in a service
.net asp.net .net-3.5 .net-2.0 64bit
We have a custom service that writes to a DB (SQL 2005).  This is a full 64-bit environment (DB, .NET service).  On one of our servers we crash every morning when we have a spike in our volume of data.  On another server we run fine.  The only differences that I've been able to notice between the two machines is that the one experiencing the crash has .NET 3.5 also installed.
Has anyone else seen this type of behavior?
Here is the event log entry from the crash today:

Have you tried to attache a debugger to the running code before the crash?  Maybe you can track down where the problem is.
You could also use adplus to get a dump of the process and then use that dump in windbg to help track down the problem.  Something like this should give you the dump file you are looking for:
adplus -crash -pn servicehost.exe
