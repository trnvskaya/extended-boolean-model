How do I get Srcsrv with SVNindex.cmd to index extern files?
svn debugging pdb-files srcsrv
I have recently made use of the SrcSrv feature in the Debugging Tools For Windows, but have noticed that when I index the pdb with SVNIndex.cmd it does not pick up any of the files that are from an external link. 
Any suggestions ?


Finally i got some time again to figure everything out:
To also get the files included with svn:externals property indexed, you just have to add the directories of them to /source= switch!
easier than i thought!
so if you have an external in "Ext1" dir under your Projectdir, just call ssindex.cmd with /source=Projectdir;Ext1 and you get all files in Ext1 also indexed.
I wrote a simple perl script, that handles the creation of the commandline for me, so you dont have to add any new external entry.
HTH, Stefan!
