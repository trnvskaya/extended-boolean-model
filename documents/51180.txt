How do I stop Visual Studio from automatically inserting asterisk during a block comment?
visual-studio
I'm tearing my hair out with this one. If I start a block comment /* in VS.NET 2005+ then carriage return, Visual Studio insists that I have another asterisk *. I know there's an option to turn this off but I just can't find it. Anyone know how to turn this feature off?


This post addresses your question. The gist of it is:
Text Editor > C# > Advanced > Generate XML documentation comments for ///


Tools->Options.
Uncheck Text Editor > C# > Advanced > Generate XML documentation comments for ///

Try this:
#if false

    whatever you want here
    and here

#endif


Visual Studio 2015 Update 2 has (finally) addressed this problem!
A new option as been added to Tools > Options > Text Editor > C# > Advanced named Insert * at the start of new lines when writing /* */ comments.
Disabling this option prevents the editor from automatically prefixing block comments with asterisks.  It only took 7.5 years and 4 major releases :)
