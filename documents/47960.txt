What are the most useful (custom) code snippets for C#?
c# visual-studio code-snippets
What are the best code snippets for C#? (using visual studio)  VB has a lot that are pre-defined, but there are only a handful for C#.  Do you have any really useful ones for C#?
Anyone want to post a good custom one you created yourself?
Anyone?... Bueller?


prop and exception are my favorites.

There's plenty of code snippets within Visual Studio for basic programming structure but I wouldn't necessarily rate one higher than another. 
I would definitely say the best ones are the custom snippets you define yourself to accomplish more specific tasks that you may find yourself using on a regular basis. Definitely a big time saver. 
A fairly basic intro to creating custom snippets can be found at http://www.15seconds.com/issue/080724.htm to help with this.

These are the ones I use daily.

prop
try
if
else
for
foreach
mbox - Message box stub
The ability to role your own.  I have one for Property that are saved in the view state, methods a custom class example.


I just started a blog, where I document short solutions in C# (code snippets) that I came up with and might prove useful to other coders.

So far I have mostly blogged about extension methods and generics.
So have a look and tell me what you think.

My absolute favorite is cw. 

I had a few on my old blog:

testmethod Code Snippet
onevent Code Snippet
cleantestresults Code Snippet
astype Code Snippet

I also have an argnull code snippet that inserts a Guard Clause that checks an argument for null and throws an ArgumentNullException, but I haven't gotten around to post that yet.

Microsoft have released a whole bunch of C# snippets that bring it up to parity with the ones for Visual Basic. You can download them here:

Just to update an older thread... here's a link for Visual Studio 2008 C# code snippet download.
