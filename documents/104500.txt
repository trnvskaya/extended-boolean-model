Flash/FLEX 3 Argument Error 2082
flex flash
Has anyone else experienced this error? Sometimes it pops up at the beginning of loading the application with Argument Error 2082. The only way I can solve it is by rebooting my machine. Restarting the browser doesn't even solve it. I have read about some solutions on the web, but I am interested in knowing what others have tried using that solved the error for them? Thanks in advance.


Are you talking about the Actionscript 3.0 Runtime Error 2082?

It's a known bug in Flash, there's a pretty long discussion about it here:

The long and short of it is you should wrap your localConnection.connect() in a try catch.
