Should the timezone be a constant or a variable?
perl datetime timezone
I have a few places in the code where I need to use the TimeZone. I can get the timezone name using DateTime::TimeZone. Is it reasonable to put the timezone name in a constant? Or should it be in a variable?


If the value can change, use a variable, of it is guaranteed to stay the same, use a constant. 
For a timezone, the chance it will change is not big, but it is also not 0. The user can change the timezone and it would be nice if the program behaves accordingly.

I vote for variable. You could end up with different users in different timezones working with your application, even if you doubt that could ever happen. It happened to me a couple of years ago.

Look at where the timezone is coming from. Is it the timezone of a city? Make it constant. Is it the timezone of the user? Make it variable - we users travel all the time, and we reset the timezone on our laptops so that Outlook scheduling will work correctly at the new location.
