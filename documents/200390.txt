Please recommend me a professional keepalive solution for our monitoring server
asp.net monitoring sysadmin
I'm looking for a tool that can be installed on our monitoring server and which allows us to perform scheduled requests to our web sites in order to keep them from shutting down (asp.net).
I don't want to use a web service since we already have a dedicated monitoring server. Our monitoring software doesn't really have the ability to do this without using some ugly workaround.
I could probably write my own but I'm a bit short on time atm.


What about using wget for Windows and a scheduled task?
