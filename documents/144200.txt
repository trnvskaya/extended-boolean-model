How do I deploy an ADF business component to the middle tier and call it using RMI?
I just cannot find any good documentation on this!


I guess you mean something like:

How to install ADF 10 runtime and deploy ADF BC app to Oracle WebLogic 103 running on Linux
Oracle Application Development Framework - Development Guidelines (10g) (PDF format).


Select the ADF BC application module and use your right button to create a business components deployment and select EJB session bean. This will create different EAR files
which you can deploy. That's all.
