Installing and configuring a barebones email server on Ubuntu
email ubuntu webserver
I've got an unmanaged Linux VPS running ubuntu that I'm using for the web server for a personal website.  I'd like to get a barebones email server up and running.  All the installation guides I've found so far are for a full-fledged email server with a webmail interface and everything.  That's a lot more than I need.  There's only two things I need:

My web application needs to be able to send email.  Specifically, it'll be emailing me when an exception occurs.
I want all email sent to [anything]@domain.com forwarded to my personal gmail account.  The server doesn't even need to retain the email or anything.

I want to reserve resources for the actual web app, so I don't want to install anything I won't need for this.


Your web application needs a SMTP server.  That server can be a hosted service like Google's or MailHop.  If you really want to be an email administrator postfix should be installed HOWTO is here.
If not:
sudo apt-get install postfix


msmtp or nullmailer sounds like it would fit the bill for the former. You could use google mail for domains for the latter.

I'll Second Postfix.  I've been using it since around 2000 - it's not that hard to set up.  However, for what you're doing (relaying to your ISP) msmtp or nullmailer as suggested by geocar will probably do the trick - they appear to be specifically designed for this sort of role - although I've never used them so I can't really comment from experience in the way I can with Postfix.
