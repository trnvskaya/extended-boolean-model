Parsing Atom & RSS in Ruby/Rails?
ruby-on-rails ruby rss atom
I'm looking for something that will let me parse Atom and RSS in Ruby and Rails. I've looked at the standard RSS library, but is there one library that will auto-detect whatever type of feed it is and parse it for me?


Googleage reveals some things.  Were they not acceptable?
Simple RSS
Ruby-Feedparser
require 'simple-rss'
require 'open-uri'
rss = SimpleRSS.parse open('http://slashdot.org/index.rdf')
rss.channel.title # => "Slashdot"


If you meet crappy feeds, you may want to use HPricot to parse the feed.

Feed Normalizer looks like it may be a good option

Feedzirra is one of the better options: http://www.pauldix.net/2009/02/feedzirra-a-ruby-feed-library-built-for-speed.html
Of course, I'm biased since I wrote it. :)

I like using niokrigi or scrapi for parsing the xml in the atom/rss feeds.

I have tried Feedzirra and SimpleRSS and I found that both work great. Feedzirra was faster though so if its performance you're looking for, you're better off with Feedzirra.

Looks like in 2009 the standart Ruby RSS library just didn't exist yet?
