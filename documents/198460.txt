How to get a random number in Ruby
ruby random
How do I generate a random number between 0 and n?


Well, I figured it out. Apparently there is a builtin (?) function called rand:
rand(n + 1)

If someone answers with a more detailed answer, I'll mark that as the correct answer.

What is wrong with rand(range)?
From Ruby Random Numbers:

If you needed a random integer to simulate a roll of a six-sided die, you'd use: 1 + rand(6). A roll in craps could be simulated with 2 + rand(6) + rand(6).
Finally, if you just need a random float, just call rand with no arguments.


As Marc-AndrÃ© Lafortune mentions in his answer below (go upvote it), Ruby 1.9.2 has its own Random class (that Marc-AndrÃ© himself helped to debug, hence the 1.9.2 target for that feature).
For instance, in this game where you need to guess 10 numbers, you can initialize them with:
10.times.map{ 20 + Random.rand(11) } 
#=> [26, 26, 22, 20, 30, 26, 23, 23, 25, 22]

Note: 

Using Random.new.rand(20..30) (using Random.new) generally would not be a good idea, as explained in detail (again) by Marc-AndrÃ© Lafortune, in his answer (again).
But if you don't use Random.new, then the class method rand only takes a max value, not a Range, as banister (energetically) points out in the comment (and as documented in the docs for Random).  Only the instance method can take a Range, as illustrated by generate a random number with 7 digits.

This is why the equivalent of Random.new.rand(20..30) would be 20 + Random.rand(11), since Random.rand(int) returns âa random integer greater than or equal to zero and less than the argument.â 20..30 includes 30, I need to come up with a random number between 0 and 11, excluding 11.

Don't forget to seed the RNG with srand() first.

While you can use rand(42-10) + 10 to get a random number between 10 and 42 (where 10 is inclusive and 42 exclusive), there's a better way since Ruby 1.9.3, where you are able to call:
rand(10...42) # => 13

Available for all versions of Ruby by requiring my backports gem.
Ruby 1.9.2 also introduced the Random class so you can create your own random number generator objects and has a nice API:
r = Random.new
r.rand(10...42) # => 22
r.bytes(3) # => "rnd"

The Random class itself acts as a random generator, so you call directly:
Random.rand(10...42) # => same as rand(10...42)

Notes on Random.new
In most cases, the simplest is to use rand or Random.rand. Creating a new random generator each time you want a random number is a really bad idea. If you do this, you will get the random properties of the initial seeding algorithm which are atrocious compared to the properties of the random generator itself.
If you use Random.new, you should thus call it as rarely as possible, for example once as MyApp::Random = Random.new and use it everywhere else.
The cases where Random.new is helpful are the following:

you are writing a gem and don't want to interfere with the sequence of rand/Random.rand that the main programs might be relying on
you want separate reproducible sequences of random numbers (say one per thread)
you want to be able to save and resume a reproducible sequence of random numbers (easy as Random objects can marshalled)


What about this?
n = 3
(0..n).to_a.sample


If you're not only seeking for a number but also hex or uuid it's worth mentioning that the SecureRandom module found its way from ActiveSupport to the ruby core in 1.9.2+. So without the need for a full blown framework:
require 'securerandom'

p SecureRandom.random_number(100) #=> 15
p SecureRandom.random_number(100) #=> 88

p SecureRandom.random_number #=> 0.596506046187744
p SecureRandom.random_number #=> 0.350621695741409

p SecureRandom.hex #=> "eb693ec8252cd630102fd0d0fb7c3485"

It's documented here: Ruby 1.9.3 - Module: SecureRandom (lib/securerandom.rb) 

rand(6)    #=> gives a random number between 0 and 6 inclusively 
rand(1..6) #=> gives a random number between 1 and 6 inclusively

Note that the range option is only available in newer(1.9+ I believe) versions of ruby.

You can generate a random number with the rand method. The argument passed to the rand method should be an integer or a range, and returns a corresponding random number within the range:
rand(9)       # this generates a number between 0 to 8
rand(0 .. 9)  # this generates a number between 0 to 9
rand(1 .. 50) # this generates a number between 1 to 50
#rand(m .. n) # m is the start of the number range, n is the end of number range


This link is going to be helpful regarding this;
http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Random.html
And some more clarity below over the random numbers in ruby;
Generate an integer from 0 to 10
puts (rand() * 10).to_i

Generate a number from 0 to 10
In a more readable way
puts rand(10)

Generate a number from 10 to 15
Including 15
puts rand(10..15)

Non-Random Random Numbers
Generate the same sequence of numbers every time
the program is run
srand(5)

Generate 10 random numbers
puts (0..10).map{rand(0..10)}


Try array#shuffle method for randomization
array = (1..10).to_a
array.shuffle.first


Simplest answer to the question:
rand(0..n)


you can do rand(range)
x = rand(1..5)


Maybe it help you. I use this in my app
https://github.com/rubyworks/facets
class String

  # Create a random String of given length, using given character set
  #
  # Character set is an Array which can contain Ranges, Arrays, Characters
  #
  # Examples
  #
  #     String.random
  #     => "D9DxFIaqR3dr8Ct1AfmFxHxqGsmA4Oz3"
  #
  #     String.random(10)
  #     => "t8BIna341S"
  #
  #     String.random(10, ['a'..'z'])
  #     => "nstpvixfri"
  #
  #     String.random(10, ['0'..'9'] )
  #     => "0982541042"
  #
  #     String.random(10, ['0'..'9','A'..'F'] )
  #     => "3EBF48AD3D"
  #
  #     BASE64_CHAR_SET =  ["A".."Z", "a".."z", "0".."9", '_', '-']
  #     String.random(10, BASE64_CHAR_SET)
  #     => "xM_1t3qcNn"
  #
  #     SPECIAL_CHARS = ["!", "@", "#", "$", "%", "^", "&", "*", "(", ")", "-", "_", "=", "+", "|", "/", "?", ".", ",", ";", ":", "~", "`", "[", "]", "{", "}", "<", ">"]
  #     BASE91_CHAR_SET =  ["A".."Z", "a".."z", "0".."9", SPECIAL_CHARS]
  #     String.random(10, BASE91_CHAR_SET)
  #      => "S(Z]z,J{v;"

  def self.random(len=32, character_set = ["A".."Z", "a".."z", "0".."9"])
    chars = character_set.map{|x| x.is_a?(Range) ? x.to_a : x }.flatten
    Array.new(len){ chars.sample }.join
  end

It works fine for me

How about this one?
num = Random.new
num.rand(1..n)


range = 10..50
rand(range)
or
range.to_a.sample
or
range.to_a.shuffle(this will shuffle whole array and you can pick a random number by first or last or any from this array to pick random one)
