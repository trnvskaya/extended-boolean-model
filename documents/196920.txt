How do I change OutDir variable in Visual C++?
visual-c++ linker
In the linker the binary destination is specified as:
$(OutDir)\$(ProjectName).exe
I've looked through every setting and I can't see where OutDir is defined. How do I change this?


It's on the very first page of the project properties

First option in the "General" section underneath "Configuration Properties".
