Is a Flex debugger included in the sdk?

I have been writing Flex applications for a few months now and luckily have not needed a full debugger as of yet, so far I have just used a few Alert boxes...
Is there an available debugger that is included in the free Flex SDK? I am not using FlexBuilder (I have been using Emacs and compiling with ant).
If not, how do you debug Flex applications without FlexBuilder? (note: I have no intentions of using flexbuilder)


I had the same problem when programming with ActionScript and having to test it on a browser. Try this. It involves using Firefox (which I believe you do) and FireBug to receive the debug messages.

A debugger called fdb is included in the Flex SDK. Here's some documentation on how to use it:
