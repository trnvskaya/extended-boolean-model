IAutomationObject not found when running Flex application
flex
i get the following error when trying to run a flex application (which has been working fine!). I was playing around with some different setttings trying to optimize the compiled size. I've put these settings back to the defaults as much as I thought but still getting issues.
I remember getting this error before but cant seem to remember how I fixed it - nor any useful information about how to fix it again! 
Anybody know?
VerifyError: Error #1014: Class IAutomationObject could not be found.

I haven't encountered this, but here are some suggestions on things I would try:

Did you exclude any classes in the compiler settings?
If you're using Flex Builder, try doing a clean (Project > Clean...).
If that doesn't help, remove all eclipse and flex builder files from your project and create a new project that points to your existing sources.


It turned out I had changed an externally referenced .swc file's embed mode set to 'External' as opposed to using it as an 'RSL'.
