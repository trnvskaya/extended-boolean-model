iPhone designmode support
iphone iframe safari ipod-touch designmode
Anyone knows if Safari on the iPhone and iPod touch supports iFrame in design mode and if so, how I can enable it? I have tried following ways, but none work (but it works on my PC):
theIframe.contentWindow.document.body.contentEditable = true;

theIframe.contentWindow.document.designMode = 'on';

theIframe.contentDocument.designMode = "on";

Thanks!


According to [1], contenteditable, at least, should work:

contenteditable
If true, the element can be edited on the fly; if false, it cannot.>
Availability
Available in Safari 1.2 and later. Available in iPhone OS 1.0 and later.

.. but it didn't for me :-(
