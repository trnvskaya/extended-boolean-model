If I'm posting a question about Oracle SQL query performance, what should I include in my question?

If I am posting a question about a query against an Oracle database, what should I include in my question so that people have a chance to answer me?  How should I get this information?
Simply providing the poorly performing query may not be enough.


The query plan is always useful


The schema definition of the tables involved.
The indexes defined on those tables.
The query you are executing.
The resulting query execution plan


Ideally, get the full query plan using DBMS_XPLAN.DISPLAY_CURSOR using the sql_id and child_cursor_id from v$sql. Failing that (ie on older versions), try v$sql_plan and include filter and access predicates. EXPLAIN PLAN is fine if it actually shows the plan that was used.
DB version and edition (Express/Standard/Enterprise). Maybe the OS too.
SELECT * FROM V$VERSION
If you have any non-standard database parameters, it is useful to know (especially anything optimizer related).
select * from v$parameter where rownum < 5 and isdefault != 'TRUE';
*If you do a 
    alter session set events '10053 trace name context forever, level 1'
and parse a query, there'll be a log file that will include all the parameters used when optimizing a query * 
Real world table sizes and column distributions (eg it is a million row table, with 30% of rows being "Red" etc). And the relevant stats off USER_TABLES, USER_TAB_COLUMNS.
How long it actually look, plus any SQL stats you have available (consistent gets, physical reads) from v$sql.
Also, who do you THINK it should be able to run faster. Do you think there's a better plan, or are you just crossing your fingers.
