Windows domain changed cause sql2005 login fail
sql-server windows dns
My company change the domain from abc to xyz and now i can't log into my local sql2005 via Windows login nor sql login.
both login gave me this error: An error has occured while establishing a connection to the server. blah blah blah...Sql server does not allow remote connection. Error:26  - Error locating Server/Instance specified.
i check the server instance is running. i can understand the windows login fail but how can sql login fail as well? does anyone know how to fix this?


It's weird but i find the solution. I select the database that i want to connect to which is the same instance on the login screen then using the sql authentication. i was able to login in. It turn out the my work station was renamed. that's why it can't find the server instance.

What server name are you using? If you're using anything other than (local), localhost, or . - then you probably need to change the server to NEWDOMAIN\HOSTNAME or hostname.newdomain.com.
