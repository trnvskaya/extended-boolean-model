Can I (re-) map commands in vim?
vim
I love vim and the speed it gives me. But sometimes, my fingers are too speedy and I find myself typing ":WQ" instead of ":wq" (on a German keyboard, you have to press shift to get the colon). Vim will then complain that 'W' is not an editor command.
Is there some way to make W and Q editor commands?


Try 
 :command WQ wq
 :command Wq wq
 :command W w
 :command Q q

This way you can define your own commands. See :help command for more information.

And you can use 
:cmap WQ wq

as well.
E.g. I have 
cmap h tab help

in my .vimrc which means opening help pages in a new tab.
Thanks for the tip Jim Stewart:

But here is a much better solution as the above (for the help mapping,
  so that it only applies when you do :h):
cnoreabbrev <expr> h getcmdtype() == ":" && getcmdline() == "h" ? "tab h" : "h"



Alternative way to do it:
Use 'command abbreviations'
:ca WQ wq
