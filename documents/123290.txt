Code analysis
visual-studio-2005 code-analysis
Does anyone know where to find an explanation to the warnings in vs 2005 codeanalysis tool. I would like some documentation, explainning why it creates the warnings it does and what course of action one should take.


You should be able to right click the warnings it gives you in the Error List and view Error Help, right from within Visual Studio.  There's also a section of MSDN articles, if you'd prefer.

I'm not sure which codeanalysis tool you are referring to.
