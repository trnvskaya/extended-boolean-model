EBNF to fluent interface
c# sql linq fluent-interface ebnf
I have recently had the need to write a fluent interface for C# that will essentially mirror SQL.  Yes, I am aware of LINQ to SQL, but I'm interesting in getting "closer to the metal"--having something that essentially provides nothing more than an Intellisensified SQL shim within C#.
E.g.,
var fq = new FluentQuery();
Expression<Action> =
    () => fq.SELECT.DISTINCT(Foo.ID).FROM(Foo).WHERE(Foo.Age > 22);

Now, I was thinking that this concept could be generalised--that is, how about a general EBNF to fluent interface generator?  Does anyone know if such a beast exists?


I like it, but you have to make sure to return types like HasFromAndSelect or something like that so you don't end up with fq.SELECT(Foo.ID).SELECT(Foo.Age).WHERE(Foo.Age > 22) or fq.WHERE(Foo.Age > 22).SELECT(Foo.ID), etc.
There's much more thought that needs to go into this, including the fact that the CAPS LOCK MODE is hurting my eyes :)

yup ! At least for java ;-) Check out Diezel
