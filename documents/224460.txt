Checkout from TFS with MSBuild
tfs msbuild
What's the easiest way to checkout a file from our TFS with MSBUILD. 
From what I can see it's to shell out to TF.EXE and manually call the checkout command. Is there really no built in command?!


There really is no built in command. Even worse, the tf checkout command only accepts a single filespec. 
The recently released MSBuildExtensionPack has some msbuild commands for TFS, but no perf gain there. Under the hood, they shell out to tf.exe

the 'itemspec' can be a list of space-delimited items and can use wildcards.
