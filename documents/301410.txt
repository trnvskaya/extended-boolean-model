Eclipse features in VisualStudio
visual-studio-2008 eclipse
This might of been asked elsewhere (seems like a useful topic) but searches turned up nothing.
One feature I love in Eclipse when programming Java is that I don't have to worry about putting in the import statements and any missed functions from interfaces that I am implementing them - if I do miss them a simple click from a list implements them for me.
Now I am working in VisualStudio2008 with C# I am really missing that functionality. I was wondering if the functionality is in there, but buried or can be purchased through a 3rd party?
Thanks.


you have to pay for this feature. Look at Resharper 4.0 from JetBrains. It is a perfect solution for me.

If you make a call to something from one of the standard libraries (or a library that is referenced by the project) which isn't "using", the intellisence will show a mark below the keyword, like so:

Hover over it and open the menu, and you can choose to add the "using" keyword, or make the typename explicit, like so:

And it then adds the "using" to the top of the file.
