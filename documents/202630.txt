How do I detect a null reference in C#?
c#
How do I determine if an object reference is null in C# w/o throwing an exception if it is null?
i.e. If I have a class reference being passed in and I don't know if it is null or not.


(YourObject != Null)

you can compare to null?
If it's null instead of throwing an exception you can initialize your object. You can use the Null Pattern.

testing against null will never* throw an exception
void DoSomething( MyClass value )
{
    if( value != null )
    {
        value.Method();
    }
}


* never as in should never. As @Ilya Ryzhenkov points out, an incorrect implementation of the != operator for MyClass could throw an exception. Fortunately Greg Beech has a good blog post on implementing object equality in .NET. 

Or if you are using value types you can read about nullable types: http://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/mosessaur/nullabletypes08222006164135PM/nullabletypes.aspx

What Robert said, but for that particular case I like to express it like this, rather than nest the whole method body in an if block:
void DoSomething( MyClass value )
{
    if ( value == null )
    {
        // I might throw an exception here, too
        return;
    }

    value.Method();
}


if(p != null)
{
   DoWork(p);
}

Also, the 'as' keyword is helpful if you want to detect if a class is of the right type and use it all at once.
IExample e = p as IExample;
if(e != null)
    DoWork(e);

In the above example if you were to cast e like (IExample)e it will throw an exception if e does not implement IExapmle. If you use 'as' and e doesn't implement IExample e will simply be null.

I have in the application's xaml.cs application derivative definition:
private SortedList myList;

And I want to be able to re-use my constructors.  So I needed:
if ( myList == null)
   myList = new SortedList();

Thanks Robert!

Note, that having operator != defined on MyClass would probably lead do different result of a check and NullReferenceException later on. To be absolutely sure, use object.ReferenceEquals(value, null)

It's nit picky, but I always code these like ...
if (null == obj) {
   obj = new Obj();
}

instead of 
if (obj == null) {
   obj = new Obj();
}

to avoid accidently writing
if (obj = null) {
   obj = new Obj();
}

because 
if (null = obj) {
   obj = new Obj();
}

will give you a compiler error

If you look in the majority of the .NET framework source code you will see they put checks like this at the top of their functions.
public void DoSomething(Object myParam)
{
  if (myParam == null) throw new ArgumentNullException("myParam");

  // Carry on
}


With C# 6.0 this is much more elegant; you can do it in one line :-)
value?.Method();

If "value" is null, nothing will happen - and no exception.
