Why does Javadoc generate non-compliant XHTML?
java javadoc xhtml
I just pasted some generated javadoc into an eclipse project, to discover none of the HTML is compliant.
There is even cases of closing tags that were never opened.
Is there some way to fix this? Maybe a "be compliant" option...


After some googling, I discovered 
XHTML Doclet 0.4.

XHTML Doclet is a standards-compliant
  alternative to the Javadoc standard
  HTML doclet. The project revises the
  document structure to exclude outdated
  tags and inline styles, creates valid
  XHTML markup, and provides better
  hooks for more flexible CSS
  manipulation.

Looks like someone made a plugin.
Any better options?
Edit: Here's the plugin's Official page as linked to by Sun's Javadoc FAQ.

The short answer is that JavaDocs predate XHTML.
There was an interesting thread on the Java Posse group about this recently that you might find interesting:
why is javadoc stuck in 1997?
