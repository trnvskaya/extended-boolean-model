DOCTYPE RSS & HTML entities
html rss feed entities
I have an "ldquo", "rdquo" and several other entities under my RSS feed. Seems like if I add
<!DOCTYPE rss [
  <!ENTITY % HTMLspec PUBLIC
  "-//W3C//ENTITIES Latin 1 for XHTML//EN"
  "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml-special.ent">
  %HTMLspec;

below the xml tag and above the rss tag then I'll be able to include those entities. I added but it doesn't seem to work. Does anyone knows what I missing? Thanks


it doesn't seem likely that many feed readers will know what to do with that.  i would recommend sticking with numbered entity references.  for example, change &ldquo; to &#8220;.  you can get the full entity reference right here from w3c.
additionally, you can read this article and this one which gives some good tips on this topic.

Forget entities. Just use UTF-8 for all characters. 
It will work reliably regardless whether RSS clients properly parse XML or not (sadly, the latter isn't uncommon).

Strangely enough but in RSS instead of  
&rsquo; 
I used
&amp;rsquo; 
and it worked in all browsers that I have (IE, Mozilla, Google Chrome)
