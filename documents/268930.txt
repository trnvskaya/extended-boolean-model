How can you emulate a mailing list in Django?
python django mailing-list
I'm on a project which is trying to write what amounts to a Mailing List app in Django, and we're running into a couple of problems/questions.
The code we have so far doesn't set various List headers, and re-sets the To header to be the person we're sending it to, instead of the list address.
Now, we can work our way through all these fiddly little details, but I was wondering if anyone had any code which already did this sort of thing that we could crib from, so that we don't have to go through all the trial-and-error ourselves.  Specific sections of RFCs that showed us what we should be sending would also be useful.
Thanks,
Blake.


Did you take a look at majordomo, or mailman?

RFC 2919 has some info and more references on this.

What about http://labs.freehackers.org/projects/colibri/wiki
It seems to do what you want: a mailing list manager with a django frontend.
