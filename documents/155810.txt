How do I configure visual studio to use the code view as the default view for Webservices?
visual-studio web-services
When you double click on a class (in 'solution explorer')... if that class happens to be an .asmx.cs webservice... then you get this...

To add components to your class, drag
  them from the Toolbox and use
  the Properties window to set their
  properties. To create methods and
  events for your class, click here
  to switch to code view.

...it's a 'visual design surface' for webservices.
(Who actually uses that surface to write webservices?)
So what I want to know, how do I configure visual studio to never show me that design view?
Or at least, to show me the code view by default?


You can set the default editor for any given file type (.cs, .xml, .xsd, etc).  To change the default editor for a given type:

Right-click a file of that type in
your project, and select "Open
With..."
Select your preferred editor. You
may want "CSharp Editor".
Click "Set as Default".

I don't see the behavior you see with web services, but this should work with all file types in Visual Studio.

Add the following attribute to your class:
<System.ComponentModel.DesignerCategory("")>


Add the following attribute to your class:
[System.ComponentModel.DesignerCategory("Code")] 

(Not sure why [System.ComponentModel.DesignerCategory("")] does not work.)
