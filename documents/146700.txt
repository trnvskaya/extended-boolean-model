Glassfish: Deploying application in domain failed; Error loading deployment descriptors - invalid bit length repeat
deployment glassfish deployment-descriptor
I'm trying to deploy a .war trough the server's web interface. Getting the same error when deploying it as an exploded directory with IDEA.
What is the solution to this problem?


The message points to an exception in java.util.zip thus implicating a corrupted packed file. Maybe you could try rebuilding the war file.
