Create an Array of the Last 30 Days Using PHP
php arrays date
I am trying to create an array starting with today and going back the last 30 days with PHP and I am having trouble.  I can estimate but I donât know a good way of doing it and taking into account the number of days in the previous month etc.  Does anyone have a good solution? I canât get close but I need to make sure it is 100% accurate.


Try this:
<?php    
$d = array();
for($i = 0; $i < 30; $i++) 
    $d[] = date("d", strtotime('-'. $i .' days'));
?>


You can use time to control the days:
for ($i = 0; $i < 30; $i++)
{
    $timestamp = time();
    $tm = 86400 * $i; // 60 * 60 * 24 = 86400 = 1 day in seconds
    $tm = $timestamp - $tm;

    $the_date = date("m/d/Y", $tm);
}

Now, within the for loop you can use the $the_date variable for whatever purposes you might want to. :-)

$d = array();
for($i = 0; $i < 30; $i++)
    array_unshift($d,strtotime('-'. $i .' days'));
