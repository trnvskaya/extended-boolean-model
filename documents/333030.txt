Open source or free financial analysis programs/libraries
statistics finance
I'm looking for something containing similar functions to Matlabâs financial and financial derivatives toolbox but donât have the cash to spend on matlab. I would appreciate any info on free or open source libraries or programs that will let me easily calculate interest rates, risk etc.


How about the Octave financial functions?

I'm not familiar with the Matlab toolbox, so you'll have to judge for yourself.

GNU Octave is a high-level language,
  primarily intended for numerical
  computations. It provides a convenient
  command line interface for solving
  linear and nonlinear problems
  numerically, and for performing other
  numerical experiments using a language
  that is mostly compatible with Matlab.
  It may also be used as a
  batch-oriented language.


How about JQuantLib or QuantLib?

Exactly what functions do you need? How advanced? You have some financial functions in .Net 
Im sure it doesnt cover everything, but calulating interests and some other are no problem:
